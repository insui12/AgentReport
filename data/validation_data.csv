[affected versions]:
- firefox nightly 93.0a1 (build id: 20210815094823)

[affected platforms]:
- mac 11.5.1
- windows 10 x64
- ubuntu 20.04 x64

[prerequisites]:
- have the latest firefox nightly browser installed.
- have a firefox profile with multiple logins saved.


[steps to reproduce]:
1. open the firefox browser with the profile from prerequisites.
2. navigate to the “about:logins” page.
3. click on the “sort by:” dropdown menu.
4. select the “username(a-z)” or the “username(z-a)” option.
5. create a new login and click on the “save” button.
6. observe what happens.

[expected result]:
- the created login is successfully created and displayed on the login list.

[actual result]:
- nothing happens. 

[regression]
- the issue is not reproducible with older nightly 93.0a1 builds. considering this using mozregression tools i have found the regression range. here are the results:

from this pushlog i think the patch for bug 1592682 introduced this behavior.

[notes]:
- the login is correctly saved, but the “create new login” modal is not dismissed, only after refreshing the page.
- after clicking the second time on the “save” button the newly created login is recognized as a duplicate.
- attached is a screen recording of the issue.","Here's my assessment:

To reproduce this bug, you need to have the latest Nightly browser installed and a profile with multiple logins saved. Here's what happens: I open the browser with that profile, navigate to the 'about:logins' page, click on the 'sort by' dropdown menu and select either 'username (a-z)' or '(z-a)', create a new login, and then save it. What should happen is that the new login gets created and shows up in the list - but instead, nothing happens! The new login isn't displayed at all. I've tried this with older Nightly builds and it works fine, so I used MozRegression tools to narrow down the problem range and found that the issue started after a certain patch was introduced (bug 1592682).

b) the touch target suggestion is offered also without focusing the search bar only on huawei mediapad m3 (android 7) : this item's height is 28dp. consider making the height of this touch target 48dp or larger.

### device information
- firefox version: firefox nightly 128 (2024-06-05)
- android device model: huawei mediapad m3 (android 7), samsung galaxy tab s8 ultra, samsung galaxy s23 ultra (android 14), samsung galaxyz fold 4 (android 14), xiaomi pad5 (android 13)","I would rate this bug report as:

And even weirder, this issue showed up even when I wasn't focusing the search bar! It's like the scanner just started making suggestions out of nowhere. On other devices I tested it on - Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra (Android 14), Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 (Android 14), and Xiaomi Pad5 (Android 13) - the issue was different: one item's touch target had a height of only 40dp, which is still pretty small.

""I'm reporting a weird issue with Firefox builds 123 and up on Windows 10 x64, macOS Ventura 13.6.2, and Ubuntu 22.04 x64.

But instead, the message pops up right away, even before you've done anything else. To reproduce this, just follow these steps: open the browser, and - voila! - the message appears.

2. You might want to rephrase some of the sentences for better clarity and concision.
3. Since you mentioned that the expected result is a dropdown list with three options (local calendar, network calendar, or account calendar), it would be helpful to include a screenshot or a visual representation of what you expect to see.

steps to reproduce:

actual results:

if the sndio backend of libcubeb is used, the resulting audio is converted from float to 16-bit integers.


expected results:

the resulting audio should be 24-bit. both firefox and sndiod use greater precision internally, so there's no point converting back and forth to 16-bit. firefox uses 'float' for sample representation (which has 24-bit precision at full dynamic range) and the sndiod server uses 24-bit fixed-point numbers.

So I've got this weird issue with Firefox freezing when I'm using Wayland (Ubuntu 22.04.1 and Ubuntu 20.04). It happens in versions 112.0a1, 111.0, and 110.0.1 - but not in other platforms like X11, Windows 10x64, or macOS 12. 

Here's what I did to reproduce the problem: first, I opened Firefox and went to this specific webpage (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/html/element/input/date). Then, I scrolled down, hovered over the calendar icon until the ""value sample"" tooltip popped up, clicked on it a few times, and opened a new tab. 

What happened instead of what I expected was that Firefox just froze! 

The weird thing is that if I start Ubuntu in X11 mode instead of Wayland, the issue doesn't happen. And with older versions like 111 and 110.0.1, you need to manually enable Wayland from the terminal - otherwise it won't reproduce. But yeah, in nightly (112.0a1) it's enabled by default.

I've attached a screen recording of what happened if you want to take a look."

i suspect this bug is a regression from sanitized unmasked_renderer bug 1722113.

### steps to reproduce

1. in firefox nightly 92, open https://mozilla.cultureamp.com/app/skills-coach/activity/24a1eee41aabfbb870f72f2158667007247b949c55ff00cf04763e31107927179d361efbef9564132177d6004a8122cf
2. click the ""next"" button four times to reach the ""get some practice naming the need"" screen.

### expected result

the video should have a play button, like in firefox 90 and 91.

### actual result

the video is blurry and has no play button. see the attached screenshot.

i see the following error about unmasked_renderer_webgl in the web console:

* disable element
* focus element (mouse or js)



actual results:

* element received styles
* document.activeelement changed to element

expected results:

* focus event should fire

same should occur with keydown events. chrome does fire keydown, focus, and blur. chrome does not fire click events.

click events on disabled elements aren't necessary for my use cases, but keydown, focus, and blur are. this is necessary to satisfy aria requirements of focusability of certain disabled elements (list items, menu items, etc).

https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#kbd_disabled_controls

if a disabled face can receive focus, it should fire a focus event and allow keyboard navigation.

if it a disable face cannot receive focus, it should not receive `:focus` state or be assigned to document.activeelement.

Hey, so I'm running into an issue with elements that have delegatesFocus set to true and are also disabled. When I create a face element with delegatesFocus enabled, attach some styles for when it gets focus, add an event listener for the focus event, disable the element, and then try to focus it (either by mouse click or using JavaScript), things don't quite work as expected. What happens is that the element does receive those special focus styles, and document.activeElement does get updated to point to my focused element - that's all good! But here's the thing: even though the element is supposed to fire a focus event when it gets focus, nothing happens. Not only that, but keydown events also don't seem to work as they should (although Chrome does fire those events, just not in this specific situation). The weird part is that if I enable the element and do all the same steps, everything works fine - the focus event fires, and keyboard navigation works like it's supposed to. This is a problem because we're talking about elements that need to be focusable even when they're disabled (like list items or menu items), which is crucial for accessibility. According to the W3C's guidelines on ARIA best practices, if an element can receive focus and is disabled, it should still fire focus events and allow keyboard navigation - so that's what I'm expecting here.

To reproduce the issue, you need to have Firefox 99.0.1 installed, set your browser search region to 'us', then open a video from a streaming site like YouTube, click the picture-in-picture button, move that window around 5-6 times, close it, and finally navigate to the 'about:telemetry#events' tab. You'd expect to see the number of 'move' events match the number of times you moved the picture-in-picture window. But what actually happens is that there's only one 'move' event displayed. I've used Mozregression to bisect the change and it looks like the issue started around January 20, 2021. I've also attached a screen recording of the issue for reference - just keep in mind that this doesn't happen on macOS 11.6."""

""So I was messing around with Firefox and noticed it kept crashing on me. The error message said something about a file called `jsonfile.sys.mjs` causing an abort. I was trying to switch between different settings servers - think of them like test environments for developers - when I'd exit the browser after just a couple seconds, it would crash. Specifically, I'd open Task Manager, create a new profile, add some custom settings (user.js), launch Firefox, and then immediately quit it. In Task Manager, you could still see the Firefox process running and eating up memory until it finally crashed.

I'm pretty sure this has something to do with these remote settings servers. When I switch from one environment to another (like from production to staging), it seems to cause the crash if I interrupt the process. But if I just wait for the sync process to finish, exit the browser normally, and then install an extension called Remote Settings Devtools, the crash goes away.

steps to reproduce:

i have prepared a benchmark with details render stats at: https://bluenote10.github.io/js-debug-projects/perf_firefox_canvas/firefox_canvas_fill_rect.html

the render function basically does:

    let ctx = canvas.getcontext(""2d"");
    ctx.clearrect(0, 0, width, height);

    for (let i = 0; i < numrects; ++i) {
      const x1 = math.random() * width;
      const x2 = math.random() * width;
      const y1 = math.random() * height;
      const y2 = math.random() * height;
      ctx.fillstyle = `hsla(0, 0%, ${math.random() * 100}%, 1)`;
      ctx.fillrect(
        math.min(x1, x2),
        math.min(y1, y2),
        math.abs(x1 - x2),
        math.abs(y1 - y2)
      );
    }

the benchmark measures the render-self-times of batches of 180 calls (i.e., 3 second batches at 60 fps). 

i've created a fresh profile to exclude influences from an outdated profile / plugins. the only explicit changes to the profile are:
- privacy.reducetimerprecision set to false for more precise stats.
- experiments with turning gfx.x11-egl.force-enabled on/off to see if it has an effect.

enabling gfx.x11-egl.force-enabled doesn't seem to have an effect.

our real world use case: we are building a website based on canvas rendering, and the user experience under firefox/linux is abysmal. profiling the app with gecko information enabled shows that the rendering function is basically stuck in plain canvas rendering calls >95% of the time.

i've also run the benchmark on my machine under windows / firefox 89, which results in a render self time of ~1.2 ms, i.e., absolutely fine and ~80 times faster than under linux. the problem seems very much specific to linux, which is why we had high hopes that egl may help, but that doesn't seem to be the case.","""good""

Reasoning:

1. Steps to Reproduce (S2R): Present
The bug report provides a clear link to a benchmark that reproduces the issue, along with a description of the render function.

2. Expected Result (ER): Present
The expected results are clearly stated for Chrome and Windows/Firefox, providing a baseline for comparison.

3. Actual Result (AR): Present
The actual results are provided in detail for Ubuntu 18.04, including mean, median, smallest delta values, largest delta values, and the effect of enabling gfx.x11-egl.force-enabled.

4. Additional Information: Partly present
While there is some additional information about the real-world use case and profiling, it could be more concise and focused on relevant details such as software version, build number, environment, etc.

I'm trying to troubleshoot some serious performance issues with my benchmark app on Linux (specifically Ubuntu 18.04) using Firefox 89.0. The app is based on canvas rendering and I've set up a test page at [https://bluenote10.github.io/js-debug-projects/perf_firefox_canvas/firefox_canvas_fill_rect.html](https://bluenote10.github.io/js-debug-projects/perf_firefox_canvas/firefox_canvas_fill_rect.html) if you want to take a look. 

What I'm seeing is that the render function gets stuck in plain canvas rendering calls for more than 95% of the time, which is really slowing things down. To make matters worse, when I run the same test on Windows with Firefox 89, it's lightning fast - we're talking ~1.2 ms, whereas on Linux, I'm getting render self times of around 97-105 ms, depending on the batch size.

I've tried a few things to troubleshoot this issue, like setting `privacy.reducetimerprecision` to false and experimenting with `gfx.x11-egl.force-enabled`, but nothing seems to have an effect. It's almost as if Firefox is just not optimized for Linux at all.

For context, I've also run the benchmark on Chrome (80.0.3987.162) and it performs much better - we're talking render self times of around 2-3 ms. So, it looks like this might be a specific issue with Firefox on Linux, rather than anything to do with egl or my machine itself."

steps to reproduce:

> 1.    how your ca first became aware of the problem (e.g. via a problem report submitted to your problem reporting mechanism, a discussion in mozilla.dev.security.policy, a bugzilla bug, or internal self-audit), and the time and date.

entrust has filed an incident for issuing ev tls certificates with incorrect jurisdiction information, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1802916. since the incident was discovered in november, revocation for some certificates has been delayed due to blackout periods.
 
> 2.    a timeline of the actions your ca took in response. a timeline is a date-and-time-stamped sequence of all relevant events. this may include events before the incident was reported, such as when a particular requirement became applicable, or a document changed, or a bug was introduced, or an audit was done.
 
-	**2022-11-28** - subscribers were contacted and were advised of the incident, the miss-issued certificates, and the planned revocation date
-	**2022-11-28** - starting after the incident was reported, subscribers provided feedback they required more time to coordinate reissuance within the annual blackout period which generally starts before us thanksgiving and ends one or 2 weeks after new year’s day.
-	**2022-12-01 17:35 utc** - compliance discussed u.a.e. issues with verification
-	**2022-12-02 19:15 utc** - compliance discussed with verification subscriber feedback
-	**2022-12-06 17:00 utc** - compliance discussed subscriber feedback with support
-	**2022-12-06 18:00 utc** - compliance meeting to discuss revocation plans and status

> 3.   whether your ca has stopped, or has not yet stopped, issuing certificates with the problem. a statement that you have will be considered a pledge to the community; a statement that you have not requires an explanation.

based on the miss-issuance, all discovered jurisdiction issues have been corrected, so certificates with the jurisdiction issue are no longer being issued. 
 
> 4.    a summary of the problematic certificates. for each problem: number of certs, and the date the first and last certs with that problem were issued.

see item 4.

> 5.    the complete certificate data for the problematic certificates.

the certificates in the attached file were not revoked or expired by the 5-day revocation timeline.

see attached file.

> 6.    explanation about how and why the mistakes were made or bugs introduced, and how they avoided detection until now.

the problem was detected in november and the incident was provided to the subscribers on 28 november 2022. entrust was pushed back by many subscribers for the following reasons:
•	azimut holding s.p.a. - large volume of certificates and will need to engage multiple departments to coordinate this effort. challenging time of year to pull teams together for the various levels of review/approval needed. requested to complete revocation by 16 december 2023.
•	experian information solutions, inc. - currently in a code freeze and business protection period until january 7th. will need to consult with various groups as 3 of the certs are in production and part of the italy division. requested to complete revocation by 15 january 2023. 
•	fidelity investments - large volume of certificates and will need to engage multiple departments to coordinate this effort. challenging time of year to pull teams together for the various levels of review/approval needed. planning to complete revocation by end of january 2023.
•	first abu dhabi bank pjsc – the 18 certificates are owned by various application teams within fab and needs to go through a change process with a planned maintenance along with the participation of multiple operations teams to replace the certificate. being a bank, the certificates are critical for the trust and functioning of the client/customer facing applications. it is nearing end of year, with holiday season and change freezes around, the approvals will be delayed. planning to complete revocation by 6 february 2023.
•	ing groep n.v. - needs extension for the remaining certificates. planning to complete revocation by 9 december 2022.

So, I wanted to file this incident report with Mozilla about an issue we're having with EV TLS certificates that were issued by Entrust with incorrect jurisdiction information.

Here's a timeline of what happened:

* On November 28th, we contacted our subscribers and let them know about the issue and the planned revocation date.
* Some of our subscribers needed more time to coordinate reissuance within their annual blackout period, which typically runs from before Thanksgiving to after New Year's Day. We took that feedback into consideration and discussed it with our compliance team.
* On December 1st, we had a meeting to discuss U.A.E. issues with verification, and on the 2nd, we met again to discuss subscriber feedback with support.
* On December 6th, we had another meeting to discuss revocation plans and status.

As for whether we've stopped or not stopped issuing certificates with this problem, I can confirm that all discovered jurisdiction issues have been corrected, so no new certificates are being issued with the same issue."

""I just found this weird issue with the login management page on Firefox. It seems that when I'm editing a saved login and I enter 'edit' mode, the 'remove' button doesn't line up properly with the other buttons like 'save' and 'cancel'. Instead, it's slightly above them, which looks a bit off. I've tried this on Windows 10, macOS 13, and Ubuntu 22 and it happens on all three platforms.

To reproduce the issue, you just need to open the 'about:logins' page, add a new login for any website, then go into edit mode while that saved login is selected, and look at the buttons. It's pretty straightforward.

I've got an issue with Firefox that I think you should know about. When I'm viewing certain pages (like cfr.mp4), I get this weird thing happening in the browser console. Even if the page doesn't display any messages, it still sends out a ""impression"" telemetry ping. What's even weirder is that this only happens when I open new tabs - not regular tabs or ones that are already open. 

I've tried to reproduce this on different versions of Firefox (beta 106.0b8 and nightly 107.0a1) across multiple platforms (Windows 10, Windows 7, macOS 12.6, and Linux Mint 20.2), and it seems to happen consistently as long as my profile is older than two days. 

To reproduce the issue, I need to follow these steps: First, open a Firefox browser from that older profile. Then, open two new tabs and focus on the address bar of the last one. Close that unfocused tab, and then open another one. Repeat this process three times, and observe what happens. What should happen is that the ""Firefox view"" cfr message shows up after the third tab is closed, but in my case, it doesn't show up at all, and that ""impression"" telemetry ping still gets sent to the browser console.

A few extra things worth noting: If I close regular tabs instead of new ones, the cfr message does appear when I unfocus the address bar. Also, if I close multiple tabs at once using the context menu option, this issue doesn't happen. Attached is a video recording of the whole thing in action."

event dialog does not remember size and default opening size is too small to show a meaningful amount of the description  particularly when attendees and the new ""you have accepted this invitation"" notification is displayed.  this means that every time the dialog is opened it requires the user to resize it to see enough of the description

To reproduce the issue:

* Just create a new Firefox profile (no big deal).
* Open it up and hover over that ""Sign in"" link - just chill for a sec.
* Observe what happens (or doesn't happen).

What I expected: The link would get an underline, like normal. But nope!

I recently noticed an issue with Firefox, and I thought it was worth reporting. So, here are the details: I'm using version 95.0a1 (which is from October 5th, 2021) on Windows 10. To reproduce the problem, you need to launch Firefox with a fresh profile, which will trigger the Life in Color theme. Then, just click to start picking your theme and color options, and choose between Soft, Balanced, or Bold - it doesn't really matter which one you pick. The issue is that the font size seems a bit too small, even though there's plenty of space to make it bigger without causing any flow issues. I think increasing the font size by just a few pixels would fix this. I've attached a screenshot (screenshot_1.png) to illustrate my suggestion. By the way, I only checked on Firefox and didn't test other operating systems yet."

""So I was trying to add a friend on Discord using Firefox and I noticed that it kept auto-filling my login info into the 'Add Friend' field - which is super weird! Apparently when you go to add a new friend, Firefox thinks it's supposed to fill in your login credentials instead of just leaving the field blank. Like, what even is going on? It's like Firefox is trying to be helpful or something, but honestly, it's really annoying and makes me look like I'm sharing my password with everyone! So yeah, basically when you go to add a friend on Discord using Firefox, it auto-fills your login info into the 'Add Friend' field instead of leaving it blank. Which is just super awkward."""

after set `document.documentelement.hidden` to `true` and load recursive iframe by setting srcdoc to `document.documentelement.innerhtml`, then subsequently call `element.requestfullscreen` the browser goes into fullscreen without any fullscreen notification (""<domain> is now in fullscreen""), as user unaware page displayed fullscreen it can leads to address bar ui spoofing.

currently the testcase is works most of the time on linux (default settings) and windows (with fullscreen transition disabled), but it still intermittent on transition enabled, even so we can ask the victim to try again (e.g. ""you're a robot, please try again"") until the spoof is success.

""I created an attachment called `fullscreen-spoof.bundle.html` and found this weird issue. If I set `document.documentElement.hidden` to `true` and load a recursive iframe by setting its `srcdoc` attribute to `document.documentElement.innerHTML`, then try to request fullscreen using `element.requestFullscreen`, the browser goes into fullscreen mode without showing that usual notification that says something like ""Your domain is now in fullscreen"". This could be a problem because users might not even realize their page has gone into fullscreen, which could lead to some serious UI spoofing.

The thing is, this issue only seems to happen sometimes. On my Linux machine with default settings, it works most of the time, and on Windows with the fullscreen transition disabled, it also works fine. But if I enable the transition, it's still hit-or-miss - I might have to ask the user to try again a few times until they get the desired result.

Interestingly, I've got another test case that seems to work even when the transition is enabled on Windows, so I'm going to finish testing that and share the details once I'm done.

2398,"steps to reproduce:
1. open fenix (or geckoviewexample)
2. enable strict antitracking/etp (to enable the content blocker).
3. navigate to rottentomatoes.com
4. confirm that tracking content is being blocked. in fenix this can be easily seen in the lock icon in the url bar in the details, whereas in geckoviewexample, a small gap at the top of the page (where an ad will otherwise appear) will remain empty when blocking is working.
5. navigate on the same tab to twitter.com
6. on fenix, confirm that tracking content is not being blocked as it should be (on gve there is no simple ui/way to tell).
7. navigate on the same tab to rottentomatoes.com
8. confirm that tracking content is still not being blocked (see step 4 for details).

very curiously, not all websites seem to trigger this bug. twitter.com and facebook.com do, but others may not. however, once it is broken, the user must toggle a setting in the ui like strict mode (more info on this shortly), or open a new tab to get it working again.

this was originally reported in https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/26059, and
several of us have been digging around to discover what's happening. we're not sure when the bug regressed, or what regressed it; it looks like it may have been a surprisingly long time ago.

note that this affects more than just the content blocker. these features are also broken:
- the anti-tracking content blocker used in strict mode (usetrackingprotection flag)
- pwa display mode support (displaymode flag)
- display desktop page mode (viewportmode flag)
- toggle page javascript on/off (allowjavascript flag)
- custom user-agent string (customuseragent flag)

evidently browsingcontexts need to have these flags set by geckoview to keep these features working. the only place where this seems to be done is in [geckoviewsettings.onsettingsupdate()](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/modules/geckoview/geckoviewsettings.jsm#68), but this is not called during navigations, only when a tab is first created, or when a setting is changed in the ui.

i've made a trivial patch which also triggers onsettingsupdate when onlocationchange begins to be handled, which fixes this. i'm not at all sure if it's the best fix here, but it's a start.

as for why this broke, i suspect that one of these things had to be true at some point, otherwise the current code would never have worked:
- onsettingsupdate was once called each time a navigation happened, and so was able to update the browsingcontext.
- the flags were once carried over to new browsingcontexts across navigations in some lower-level code, and so did not have to be re-set.
- browsingcontexts somehow did not change before, so the flags did not need to be re-set in the first place.

It's like it got stuck or something.

What's weird is that not all websites trigger this bug - some might, while others won't. And once it breaks, you need to toggle a setting or open a new tab to get the blocker working again.

I originally reported this issue on GitHub, and we've been trying to figure out what went wrong. It looks like it's been broken for a pretty long time, but we're not entirely sure when or why it happened.

What's really frustrating is that this bug affects more than just the content blocker - it also breaks other features like PWA display mode support, desktop page mode, toggle JavaScript on/off, and custom user-agent strings. These features all rely on certain flags being set by Geckoview in each browsing context, but right now they're only getting set when you create a new tab or change settings in the UI - not during navigation.

I managed to whip up a simple patch that fixes this by calling `GeckoviewSettings.onSettingsUpdate()` whenever the location changes. It's not the most elegant fix, but it gets the job done. And honestly, I'm not entirely sure why this broke in the first place, but my hunch is that one of three things happened: either `onSettingsUpdate()` used to get called every time you navigated, or the flags were previously being carried over to new browsing contexts somehow, or maybe the browsing contexts just didn't change before and didn't need re-setting. Who knows?"""

To reproduce it, you just need to launch Firefox, go to the about:newtab page, and inspect the cogwheel icon in the top-right corner of the page.

- install https://accessibilityinsights.io/ and launch it.
- launch firefox on a page with underlined anchors eg: https://www.google.com/search?q=firefox
- try to hover over a html element other than anchor. it should work

Hey, I'm having some trouble with Firefox on Windows when trying to get details about an HTML element hovering over it using Windows UI Automation (WAI) for accessibility purposes.

* Grab Accessibility Insights from https://accessibilityinsights.io/ and fire it up.
* Launch Firefox on a page with some underlined anchors (like https://www.google.com/search?q=firefox).
* Hover over an element that's not an anchor - should work fine.
* Try hovering over one of those blue anchor links... Firefox will tell you the whole window is under the cursor!

I've tested this on two different Windows builds: Windows 11 preview and Windows 10 Pro 22h2. But, interestingly, it doesn't happen on my older Firefox ESR version (102.13.0). I even wrote a simple C++ console program to confirm it's not Accessibility Insights' fault - you can grab the source code attached here (should compile just fine with Visual Studio and no extra setup needed).

The actual result is that when WAI asks Firefox what element is under the cursor, Firefox incorrectly says it's the entire window... even though I'm hovering over a specific anchor! The expected outcome should be that Firefox correctly reports the HTML anchor as the element under the cursor."

So, I was using Firefox in French mode and came across this weird issue. When I right-clicked an image on a webpage, I expected the ""Save Image As"" option to pop up when I pressed 's' - that's what it usually does. But instead, nothing happened! It turns out there are two menu items with the same shortcut letter ""s"", one being ""Enregistrer l'image sous"" (which is French for ""Save Image As"") and another being ""Choisir l'image comme fond de l'écran"" (""Choose Image as Background""). The problem is that when I press 's', neither of these options gets executed. It's like Firefox is confused about which one to do!

steps to reproduce:

- open a context menu that has disabled menuitems. i.e. right click on a video player on youtube
- use arrow keys to advance/rewind ""focus""


actual results:

- disabled menuitems can still gain `_moz-menuactive` attribute, even though there is no visual feedback to show that they are focused or hovered
- that is, the css rules that style the active menuitems explicitly say `:not([disabled=""true""])`, or they have some overriding rule like `[_moz-menuactive=""true""][disabled=""true""] {color: graytext;  background-color: unset;}`, so you can't tell whether a disabled button is ""active"" (in this case meaning keyboard-focused or cursor-hovered)
- from a sighted user's point of view, it looks like you're advancing down the list, then all of a sudden the cursor showing the selected menu/menuitem just abruptly disappears, before reappearing when you navigate to the next non-disabled element in the list.


expected results:

- those rules are clearly intended to prevent visual feedback that would mislead a sighted user into thinking the element is an active affordance.
- but the functions that advance through menuitems do not abide by the same philosophy. this could mislead a blind or visually impaired user depending on their screen reader settings, but presumably it's also visually confusing and annoying for sighted users, (at least for me) since an element that can't be activated or interacted with in any way is being pseudo-focused, so it's consuming keyboard inputs. and meanwhile, there's no visual indication that it's holding focus except for the absence of highlighting on any other menuitems in the list.
- there's a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14841) from 2 decades ago making the opposite argument. i know there are differing opinions on this, since the existence of the disabled button should still be apparent to screen readers. but there are ways to make disabled buttons visible to screen readers and still let the keyboard navigation walker skip them. look at the customizable toolbar buttons for example.
- looking at the most modern parts of firefox, i can't find any examples of focus behaving like the context menus do. but i can find a ton of counterexamples, like [browser-toolbarkeynav.js](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser-toolbarkeynav.js#65), [panelmultiview.jsm](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/customizableui/panelmultiview.jsm#1594), even [the basic button element](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/content/widgets/button.js#189).
- also, making disabled buttons known to screen readers is not the be-all, end-all, since the buttons do not provide any information as to why they are disabled. even with vision, the most a user can glean from their existence is the fact that they could conceivably provide the named functionality in some other, unknown circumstance.
- i still think that's valuable information so i wouldn't want them hidden, either visually or to screen readers, but i think the priority of visibility should be lower than that of avoiding the confusion caused by permitting disabled elements to be focused, especially when there's no visual feedback. ideally, they should be read by screen readers but not focusable at all, just like toolbar buttons with open popups. to that end, context menus could use the same kind of node filter setup that the javascript key navigation modules use.","I'd rate this bug report as ""good"".

""I've been noticing this weird issue where I can still focus on disabled menu items in Firefox even when they're not actually usable. For example, if you right-click on a YouTube video and then use the arrow keys to navigate through the context menu, you'll find that the disabled options are somehow ""active"" again - they get a special attribute called `_moz-menuactive` and the CSS rules styling them don't take into account whether they're actually focusable. This is weird because it looks like nothing's happening from a sighted user's perspective, but for someone using a screen reader, it could be really confusing.

What I think should happen is that these disabled menu items shouldn't be focusable at all - the same way toolbar buttons with popups don't get focused when they're open. It seems to me that there are some old bugs (like this one from 2002) that argue for leaving disabled elements visible to screen readers, but I think it's more important to avoid confusing users who can't see the menu items in the first place.

I know there are different opinions on this, but my gut feeling is that we should prioritize avoiding confusion and only make these elements focusable if they're actually usable. For example, we could use the same kind of node filter setup that some JavaScript modules use to skip over disabled elements when navigating with the keyboard."""

""When I use a screen reader like NVDA or VoiceOver on Windows 10, macOS, or Ubuntu 22 to navigate the subtitle settings pane in YouTube's pip (picture-in-picture) mode, something weird happens. Specifically, when I focus on the subtitle toggle button and press the spacebar, nothing gets announced - no voiceover, no text-to-speech output, nada! Same thing happens when I use VoiceOver or Orca on a Mac or Ubuntu respectively. The panel opens up fine, but there's no announcement about it. And get this - even when I focus on the toggle itself and press tab to explore its functionality, still nothing gets announced! For example, on Windows 10 with NVDA, it just says ""checkbox checked"", which is pretty useless. Same thing happens on a Mac or Ubuntu - it's like the screen reader has no idea what's going on. I'm not sure if this is super important for accessibility purposes, but thought it was worth reporting."""

steps to reproduce:

put my laptop through suspend resume cycle.



actual results:

fonts became garbled, icons not visible - see screenshot. even new tabs display garbled fonts.

this seems to be specifically caused by recent nightly switch to egl. i've tried turning egl on in earlier versions of nightly and saw same results.

Hey, I just ran into a weird issue with Firefox after my laptop went through a suspend-resume cycle.

Hey, so I've got a weird issue with Firefox. When I'm on the ""Privacy"" settings page and click on ""Settings for Autoplay"", add a website to the list, and then press the tab key repeatedly to focus on the status button, something's not quite right. What should happen is that the focus should be fully visible on the selected website - think of it like a little highlight or underline showing me where my cursor is. But instead, I only see it at the bottom of the button, which isn't super helpful. This issue seems to be affecting Firefox 90.0b3 and 91.0a1 on Windows 8.1 and 10, as well as Ubuntu 20.04 (I didn't test other platforms). I've attached a screenshot that shows what I'm talking about - let me know if you can reproduce it too! Oh, and just to note: my Mac isn't affected in the same way; when I press tab, nothing happens at all, which might be related or maybe not."
3925,"user agent: mozilla/5.0 (x11; ubuntu; linux x86_64; rv:121.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/121.0

steps to reproduce:

1) create a recurring event (ex: every day at 12pm)
2) create an exception by changing the hour of an occurence (ex: from 12 to 13pm)
3) update all the recurring event, changing the hour (ex: from 12pm to 14pm)


actual results:

- the recurring event is moved from 12 to 14pm
- the event exception is moved from 13pm to 15pm

lightning seems to keep some kind of ""+1 hour"" concept in mind, which could induce user errors when managing meetings and invitations.



expected results:

i would expect the exception to behave in one of two ways:

- not moving at all, being an exception (13pm)
- be moved at the new given hour, since the user is changing ""all occurences"" (14pm)

users in our use cases (french ministry of ecological transition and territorial cohesion) would rather have the exceptions not changed at all when the recurring event is updated.","Here's my assessment:

""I'm running into an issue with Lightning, specifically with recurring events that I've created with exceptions. Here's what happens: I create an event that repeats daily at 12pm, then I make an exception to one of those occurrences by changing it to 1pm instead. Later, when I update all the occurrences of that event and change the start time to 2pm, I'd expect the exception to either stay put at 1pm or get updated to 3pm accordingly. Instead, what happens is that both the recurring event and its exception get bumped up an hour, so the event starts at 2pm and the exception starts at 2pm as well. This 'plus one hour' behavior is confusing and might cause users to accidentally change meeting times or invitations. Ideally, I'd like it if the exceptions stuck to their original time when updating a recurring event - it's more intuitive that way. We're dealing with sensitive use cases here involving government ministries, so accuracy is crucial."""

html file to test iframe print bug

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (macintosh; intel mac os x 10.15; rv:121.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/121.0

steps to reproduce:

- create a text input field on the main page: add a text input field to a webpage. this field should have an associated blur and focus event handler that triggers a noticeable action (e.g., an alert or a console log).

- add an iframe to the same page: insert an iframe onto the same webpage.

- create a print button on the main page: place a button on the main page, outside the iframe. this button should be linked to a function that triggers the print command for the iframe's content (e.g., window.frames['printtestiframe'].print()).

- interact with the text input: focus on the text input field and then click away to trigger the focus and blur event. observe that the blur and focus events function as expected.

- use the print button: click the print button on the main page to invoke the print functionality for the content of the iframe.

- select 'print using system dialogue': in firefox's print dialogue, navigate to 'more settings' and select 'print using system dialogue'.

- complete or cancel the print job: in the system print dialogue, either proceed with the print command or cancel the print job.

- attempt to trigger the blur and focus event again: after closing the print dialogue, return to the text input on the main page. focus on the input and then click away to test if the blur and focus events trigger.

- observe the behavior: notice that the blur and focus event no longer triggers after using the system print dialogue.

this bug does not seem to appear in other chromium based browsers or safari. all testing was performed on mac os 14 and 12 on two different chipsets intel and silicon.

issue first appeared in version 119 and has persisted since.

(example document implementing these steps attached)


actual results:

following the use of the system print dialogue to print iframe content, the blur and focus events on the main page's text input field stops functioning. this issue affects all open tabs in the session and persists until firefox is restarted or a new window is created. on some occasions if you have a new window open before causing the bug you can remedy the effects of the bug if the second window has a text input focused already. 


expected results:

the blur and focus events should consistently trigger each time the text input is focused and loses focus, regardless of the previous interaction with the system print dialogue.","Here's my assessment:

""So I created this attachment (9375362) to test out an iframe print issue in Firefox. Here's what happens: I started by creating a text input field on a webpage and adding some event handlers for blur and focus that trigger a noticeable action (like popping up an alert or logging something to the console). Then, I added an iframe to the same page. Next, I created a print button outside the iframe that prints out the contents of the iframe when clicked. Everything seemed normal until... I focused on the text input field, clicked away to trigger the focus and blur events (which worked as expected), and then used the print button to print out the iframe's content using the system print dialogue. Weird thing is, after completing or canceling the print job, the blur and focus events stopped working for that text input field on my main page - not just in that tab, but in all open tabs until I restarted Firefox or opened a new window! And get this: if I had another window open before causing the bug, sometimes I could fix it by focusing on a text input field in that other window. So yeah, this issue started showing up in Firefox version 119 and has been hanging around ever since. Weirdly enough, it doesn't seem to happen in other Chromium-based browsers or Safari."""

Then, exit the fullscreen mode and move the browser window over to the secondary monitor (the 4k one). Now, go back into fullscreen mode again... and that's when things get weird.

502,"steps to reproduce:

we recently noticed that our service worker based product runs into a major issue in firefox. under specific circumstances we see that responses streamed by our service worker take pretty much exactly 5 seconds to complete. when looking at the individual chunks arriving it seems like all content chunks arrive in normal time (usually at most 1 to 2 seconds) but the readystate change to done is not coming until 5 seconds have elapsed.

we have yet to find clear indicators to narrow down easy reproduction steps for this issue. what we know so far:
- we were able to observe this problem in production on different websites running our service worker based product. it seems only specific machines are affected since only parts of our local machines can reproduce this. so far we only observed this behavior directly on macbooks with m1 pro chips, not on regular m1/m2 macbooks and windows machines. in case the problem occurs we observe the problem for almost all page loads.
- we can identify this problem in our real user monitoring data and it seems not to be tied to a specific os. we see mac, windows and android users experiencing the problem. in case the problem occurred for a user we observed roughly 50% of page loads are affected.


actual results:

in parallel to the navigate request our service worker does a second request retrieving a html. once the page is loaded a script within the navigated page requests the preloaded resource via xhr and the service worker streams the already started response to the script. we can observe all content chunks arriving in readystate loading in expected time but the switch to readystate done does not come until 5 seconds have elapsed. it does not make a difference whether the request is made via xhr or fetch. it does seem however like additional factors (e.g. response size or timing) play a role in the issue happening as we were not yet able to reproduce the issue in a more basic setup.


expected results:

after all content chunks arrive we expect an timely change of readystate to done to proceed processing the content without added seconds of blocking time.","Based on your request, I would rate this bug report as:

**Good**

1. Steps to Reproduce (S2R): While not explicitly provided, the report does offer some context and details about the specific circumstances under which the issue occurs. This provides a good starting point for investigation.
2. Expected Result (ER): Clearly stated what was expected to happen, which helps in understanding the problem's impact on the product or service.

""We're seeing a weird issue with our service worker-based product on Firefox where responses take exactly 5 seconds to complete under specific circumstances. What happens is that all the content chunks arrive normally (usually within 1-2 seconds), but then there's a delay before the 'done' readystate change kicks in, and that's when we start seeing the issue. The weird thing is that it only seems to affect certain machines - specifically MacBooks with M1 Pro chips (not regular M1/M2 or Windows machines). We've noticed this problem on different websites where our service worker product is running, and it looks like roughly 50% of page loads are affected when the issue occurs. What's really puzzling is that our real user monitoring data shows that users from Macs, Windows, and Android devices are all experiencing this issue, so it doesn't seem to be tied to a specific OS. To reproduce the issue, we're doing two requests in parallel - one for the page and another for an HTML file. Once the page is loaded, a script within the page makes an XHR request for a preloaded resource, and that's when our service worker starts streaming the response. What we're seeing is that all the content chunks arrive in expected time (readystate 'loading'), but then there's this 5-second delay before the readystate changes to 'done', which is causing issues with processing the content.

I've been using Firefox with two extensions - Grammarly and uBlock Origin - as well as Enhanced Tracking Protection, and none of them caused any issues with BBC video playback until recently. Now, it's become super slow and laggy. For example, if I try to watch this news article video: https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-57337298, the video rendering is really poor - sometimes the audio starts playing before the video even shows up! It's like it's trying to catch up. This issue started after I switched from Ubuntu 21.04 (non-LTS) to Fedora, and I've noticed that Firefox performance has taken a hit ever since. Interestingly, Chromium works fine for me when I use it as my backup browser. I'm on Firefox version 89.0, which I installed through DNF on Fedora."

#### we performed the initial investigation and we found the following

###### 2018-04-21
- microsec installed an automatic check in the ca software which limits the usability of the different certificate profiles according to the type of the public key in the enduser certificate. the operation is based on a configuration file, which lists the allowed certificate profiles for a given key type in a given ica.

###### 2020-03-05
- version 2.13 of our public policies was released. this included the correct requirement for ku bits in case of ecc key.
- certificate profiles were updated according to the cp change to use version 2.13 cp oid values. certificate profiles included the appropriate ku setting for ecc based certificates.

###### 2020-03-09
- the ov certificate was issued under our rsa based ica ""e-szigno ssl ca 2014"", but for an ecc end-entity key.  microsec does not usually mix different key types, it was an exception event that we have issued a certificate for en ecc key from an rsa based ca hierarchy.
- the ro officer issued the certificate using the default rsa certificate profile
- the ca allowed the issuance of the certificate for the ecc key with an rsa certificate profile due to a configuration problem
- the certificate became faulty because an improper certificate profile was used for issuance, which resulted the incorrect ku setting
- the manual immediate post issuance quality control check did not recognize the fault


###### 2021-01-07
- microsec introduced the automatic cablint and zlint checks for each tls certificates which replaced the former manual checks.

###### 2020-2021
- microsec developed its certificate policy management system in two steps during 2020 and 2021. it results higher accountability and minimize the risk of misissuance.


#### summary of the findings

the misissuance was caused by a configuration problem in the certificate profile management system 
- ro officer selected the standard rsa based certificate profile for the ecc key in the rsa based ca (it is not her/his task to check the key type)
- the rsa based certificate profile was allowed for ecc keys in the rsa based ca due to a configuration problem (configuration fault)
- the certificate was issued with improper ku bits
- the manual immediate post issuance quality control check did not identify the problem
- the following quarterly quality control check did not select this specific certificate to re-check in april 2020

---

> vii -- list of steps your ca is taking to resolve the situation and ensure such issuance will not be repeated in the future, accompanied with a timeline of when your ca expects to accomplish these things.

#### immediate actions

- microsec revoked the affected ov tls certificate within 3 hours.
- microsec has verified all active certificate profiles, they were ok at the time of misissuance, and they are still ok.
- microsec has verified all active policy documents, they were ok at the time of misissuance and they are still ok.
- a quick initial investigation was made to find out the reason of the misissuance.
- microsec identified the causes of the misissuance as you see it above.
- microsec has verified the configuration of the certificate profiles in the ca software, it is ok.
- microsec checked all the valid certificates for this type of problem, there is no more certificate with this problem.
- microsec opened an incident bug in mozilla's bugzilla with the present report.


#### further planned actions

##### deadline: 2021-09-15

- microsec will check wether the present controls are sufficient to prevent a misissuance with this problem again.
- microsec will keep a training for the ro operators how to use the proper certificate profiles according to the type of the enduser key.

I'm writing to report an issue that came up recently. We received an email about a TLS certificate that was issued incorrectly on August 31st, and I want to walk you through what happened.

First, our team started investigating as soon as we got the alert at 9:36 AM. By 8:27 AM, one of our customer service officers had opened up an internal bug and started looking into the cause of the problem. We figured out that it was due to a configuration issue with our certificate profiles.

By 10:12 AM, we'd already revoked the faulty certificate, so there's no risk of further misissuance. In terms of whether we've stopped issuing certificates with this problem, we haven't had to - our quick investigation showed that our policy documents and current certificate profiles are okay, and there's no need to suspend issuance.

The issue itself was pretty specific: one OV certificate with an ECC key was issued with the wrong key usage bits. This happened on March 9th, 2020, and it was only detected because of an email alert. We're still trying to figure out why our manual post-issuance quality control check didn't catch this problem earlier.

Looking into what went wrong, we found that back in April 2018, we introduced an automatic check to limit certificate profiles based on the type of public key. Then, in March 2020, we updated our policy documents and certificate profiles to use version 2.13 OID values - but somehow, this didn't get applied correctly in one case.

We're taking steps to resolve the situation and prevent it from happening again. First, we've revoked the affected certificate and verified that all active certificate profiles are still okay.

* By September 15th, we'll review whether our current controls can prevent this kind of misissuance again.
* We'll also provide training for our RO operators on how to use the right certificate profiles based on end-user key types.

steps to reproduce:

* use a pac to proxy some requests via socks5 (remote dns)
* open a couple of tabs, use some extensions that sends background requests (e.g. google keep, gmail, mastodon, the inoreader addon)
* wait until at least one request hangs because the proxy connects but receives no traffic and keeps waiting


actual results:

the parent process starts to consume more than 100% cpu for some time. i notice because the fan starts spinning wildly.

when it happens, the ui is hardly responsive. i can only click on the profiler's icon and wait until firefox calms down.




expected results:

no high cpu usage. if the request hangs, firefox should just wait until it times out. firefox should remain responsive.

this also happens when a new tab request hangs but that's less likely for me. this has being happening for at least several days.

i don't know if the proxy plays part in this. if the request isn't going via the proxy, i won't know it hangs. i'm still looking for other clues on how it reproduces.

""I've been experiencing some weird issues with Firefox when I use a proxy (via SOCKS5) to route some requests through my remote DNS. What happens is that if I have multiple tabs open and using extensions that send background requests (like Google Keep, Gmail, or Mastodon), eventually one of those requests will hang because the proxy connection establishes but doesn't receive any traffic - it just keeps waiting. When this happens, the parent process starts guzzling CPU resources like crazy, to the point where my fan starts spinning out of control! The UI becomes super unresponsive too, making it feel like I'm stuck in a freeze frame. I can only click on the Profiler icon and wait for Firefox to calm down before things get back to normal. What's even more annoying is that when this happens, Firefox doesn't respond at all - not even to clicking the tabs or trying to close them out. I'd expect it to just timeout after a while if the request hangs, but nope! As for expected results, I figure it should be able to handle requests that hang without going bonkers on CPU usage and keeping me from using the browser. This has been happening consistently over the past few days, so I'm hoping someone can help me debug this issue."""

""Hey team, I've got a weird issue to report. So, on Firefox Profile accounts.firefox.com, if you upload an SVG file with malicious code (don't worry, I'll get to that in a sec), it looks like it can lead to stored XSS attacks - but fortunately, the Content Security Policy (CSP) blocks them. However, here's the thing: even though the attack is blocked, the malicious image file gets stored on the server, which means an attacker could potentially exploit this and go after the server directly if they wanted to. Yeah, that doesn't sound great.

The payload I used was a simple SVG file with some JavaScript code injected into it (I'll spare you the details). When I uploaded it to my profile image, the XSS code didn't execute immediately - but if I right-clicked on the image and opened it in a new tab, the attack would trigger. Of course, the CSP kicked in and blocked it, but that's not the point: the fact is, this vulnerability exists.

To reproduce the issue:

1. Open Firefox
2. Go to your account profile
3. Click ""Change Image Profile""
4. Attach the malicious SVG file (like xss.svg)
5. Right-click on the image and inspect the element
6. Preview the image upload/open link in a new tab
7. The XSS attack should trigger (but get blocked by CSP)

Actual results: the XSS attack gets blocked, but the malicious file is stored on the server.

Expected results: I expected the XSS attack to pop up, but get filtered out by the CSP."""

My expectation is that since most users aren't tech-savvy and wouldn't know about (or feel comfortable using) the about:config page, it would be helpful if there was a simple UI option to turn GPC on or off.

So I'm experiencing this weird issue with Firefox 87.0 on my Ubuntu machine. Here's what happens: when I load a super simple HTML page (basically a blank page) from a local server, and it has some specific headers like `cross-origin-embedder-policy`, `cross-origin-resource-policy`, and `cross-origin-opener-policy` set to certain values, Firefox crashes the tab and brings up this annoying ""Tab Crash Reporter"" page that says something like ""Gah, your tab just crashed!"" and asks if I want to report or close/restore it. What's supposed to happen instead is that a print preview should pop up when I hit Ctrl-P.

But if I disable that setting again, everything works as expected: I can see and make changes to active rules in real-time.

So, I'm seeing this weird issue with the left pane in DevTools' Storage tab. When I open a website, fire up DevTools, switch to the Storage tab, and expand all those trees on the left side (you know, the ones that normally take up most of the screen), the problem arises. Even though there's a scrollbar present, none of the items actually show up - instead, you get this weird white padding at the bottom that just bounces up and down when you try to scroll. And if I focus on the right pane (where all the actual data is displayed), good luck getting it to scroll! It just doesn't want to play ball.

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:86.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/86.0

steps to reproduce:

prerequsites: gpu-acceleration must be enabled
tested on windows 10, on firefox 86 and the latest nightly release.
gpu: nvidia rtx 2080,

1) open the attached index.html in a new tab
2) press the ""click me!"" button
3) observe the memory usage of firefox increasing
4) be aware that if memory usage exceeds available memory the system might hang


actual results:

the memory usage of the gpu thread will rapidly and acceleratingly increase in size, potentially to the point where the user's machine will hang.
in my tests it levels out around 9,5gb of used memory (which was when the memory usage on my system reached 100%). i also managed to hang the system once when another application started digging into the already empty memory.

occasionally the gc will come in and clear memory, but it will not do this enough to prevent firefox from accumulating ram.

the memory should not increase at such a rapid rate. and the application should not crash the system","**Best**

""I created an attachment (9207952) called index.html, which I'll walk you through what happens when you open it in Firefox 86 or the latest nightly release on Windows 10 with GPU acceleration enabled. My setup: I'm using a NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU, and my user agent is Mozilla/5.0. Here's how to reproduce the issue:

First, make sure GPU acceleration is turned on. Then, follow these steps: open index.html in a new tab, click the ""Click me!"" button, and observe Firefox's memory usage increasing rapidly (we're talking GBs here!). If you let it go unchecked, your system might even hang due to low memory availability.

In my tests, I saw the GPU thread memory usage shoot up to around 9.5GB before leveling off (which was when my system memory reached 100%). And if another app starts using up available memory? Forget about it - the whole system will crash! It's like Firefox just keeps accumulating RAM without stopping.

Now, occasionally the garbage collector (GC) does kick in and clear out some memory, but even that isn't enough to prevent Firefox from hogging all the RAM. My expectation is that the memory shouldn't increase so wildly, and the app should be able to run without crashing the system."""

I ran into an issue where if I set the `reportvalidity()` function as a callback for the `canvas.toblob` property and also enabled `contenteditable`, the validation message would persist even after I closed the tab. And to make things worse, this message would still be visible on the previous active tab, like it was stuck there or something! 

It gets even more interesting - using this bug, I managed to spoof a validation message on Twitter, which then overlapped with their own button intent (like when you press enter to retweet or like something). And because this message looks like it's coming from the website, users are likely to trust it and won't notice that pressing enter is actually going to retweet or like the tweet. 

By the way, it seems that this bug is a regression of an older issue (#1684792) where form validation popups would be anchored at screen coordinates in out-of-process iframes.

It happens on three different platforms - Windows 10 x64, Linux Mint 20, and macOS 11.2.3 - using both the beta version (89.0b14) and nightly build (90.0a1). The issue only shows up if I create a brand new Firefox profile and then go through the ""about:welcome"" page. Here's what happens: when I click on the ""not now"" buttons on the first two slides, I expect to see the theme options displayed normally. But what actually happens is that there's this weird gap between the ""system theme"" and ""light"" options, as well as between the ""dark"" and ""alpenglow"" options - it's like they're spaced out unevenly.

Set two specific settings - `browser.proton.enabled` and `browser.proton.infobars.enabled` - to true, but don't restart just yet.

I've been having this issue with Firefox since updating to version 120 (and it persists even after rolling back to 121). I'm experiencing problems on both my Mac running Monterey 12.7.2 and Windows 11 machine, which I recently updated to the latest December 2023 patch. I know that plugins and extensions can sometimes cause issues, so I tried doing a clean install of Firefox on each system, deleting all my profile folders and starting from scratch - no luck there either. I also disabled any proxy settings, made sure HTTPS was only being used, and checked my DNS settings to rule out any misconfigurations causing the problem. Still nothing.

What happens is that Firefox starts up just fine, but when I try to load a website, it can't connect at all. On my Mac, it gives me a ""connection timed out"" error message, and if I keep trying and refreshing, it eventually works after 5-10 minutes (but only until I close the browser, then it gets stuck again). On Windows 11, Firefox just can't connect to any website, no matter how long I wait or refresh. What I expect is that I should be able to browse the web without any issues - but unfortunately, that's not what's happening!"

""So I was testing out an update for Firefox on my Windows 10 machine (64-bit), as well as on my Mac running macOS 11 and Ubuntu 18.04, and I noticed something weird. I had downloaded an 'ia' locale build of Firefox, which is the Hebrew version, and when I went to Help > About Firefox, I expected to see the download progress bar showing me how much longer it would take to update. Instead, nothing showed up in the update status field until I closed and reopened the About Firefox UI. Not only that, but I also saw an error message in the browser console saying 'this.downloadstatus is null'. It's like the update process just freezes or something. And get this - on 88.x, there's literally no progress bar at all until you close and reopen the About Firefox window. Super weird. I've attached a screen recording to help illustrate what I'm talking about. Oh, and by the way, it seems that 85.0.2 isn't affected by this issue, which is good news I guess. I'll keep looking for other affected versions."""

steps to reproduce:

starting with firefox 101, i noticed that a launched window's initial tab does not appear to be registered as an available target and does not get returned by `target.gettargets`. this only appears to be a problem in windows, with my repro environment being on windows 10.

to reproduce:

1. start firefox 101 with remote debugging enabled:

`start 'c:\program files (x86)\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe' 'about:blank', '--remote-debugging-port=51959'`

2. connect to launched instance and issue `target.gettargets` message (simple script provided here: https://gist.github.com/tbiethman/9add1e991efbecdbe3e6eddec9fb4b46)


actual results:

with firefox 101, the `target.gettargets` message resolves with no found targets, with script output:

```
found targets
{ targetinfos: [] }
```


expected results:

the initial tab target should be returned, with the script output looking something like:

```
found targets
{
  targetinfos: [{
    targetid: 'xxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxx',
    type: 'page',
    title: '',
    url: 'about:blank',
    attached: false,
    browsercontextid: null,
  }]
}
```
this is what returns when running the repro steps against firefox 100 in windows. this is also the behavior exhibited by the macos version of firefox 101, with the initial tab target returning as expected.

----

a data couple points that might be relevant:

* with firefox 101, if i spawn another window (with ctrl+n) from the initial window, the script will start returning targets upon subsequent executions.
* also with firefox 101, if i spawn the initial window in troubleshooting mode (with the `-safe-mode` option), the tab does return as a target for the initial window.
* i thought that this may be due to differences in handling of 'about:blank' in v101, but launching to an actual location (say, 'https://www.mozilla.org') still results in no targets being returned.

if i can provide can other data points that could be helpful, or if i've missed something completely in the protocol and this behavior is now expected, please let me know.","Here's the assessment:

""I'm reporting an issue with Firefox 101 on Windows 10. When I launch a new window using remote debugging, the initial tab doesn't seem to register as a target and isn't returned by `target.gettargets`. This is only happening on Windows - my repro environment is set up with Windows 10 and Firefox 101.

To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:

1. Start Firefox 101 with remote debugging enabled using the command: `start 'c:\program files (x86)\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe' 'about:blank', '--remote-debugging-port=51959'`.
2. Connect to the launched instance and run a simple script that issues the `target.gettargets` message (check out this gist for the script: https://gist.github.com/tbiethman/9add1e991efbecdbe3e6eddec9fb4b46).

What happens instead is that the `target.gettargets` message resolves with no found targets. The output looks like this:

```
found targets
{ targetinfos: [] }
```

But what I expect to see is the initial tab target returned, with an output like:

```
found targets
{
  targetinfos: [{
    targetid: 'xxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxx',
    type: 'page',
    title: '',
    url: 'about:blank',
    attached: false,
    browsercontextid: null,
  }]
}
```

This is what happens when I run the same steps against Firefox 100, and also on the Mac version of Firefox 101 - the initial tab target returns as expected.

A couple more data points that might be relevant:

* If I spawn another window from the initial one (using Ctrl+N), the script starts returning targets after subsequent executions.
* If I launch the initial window in troubleshooting mode (-safe-mode option), the tab does return as a target for the initial window.
* I thought maybe this was related to how Firefox 101 handles 'about:blank', but launching to an actual location (like https://www.mozilla.org) still results in no targets being returned.

I'm seeing an issue where the ""Edit This Site"" button in Firefox gets stuck in a selected state when you click on it from the top sites section and then hit the Esc key. This happens on multiple versions of Firefox, including 95.0a1, 94.0, 93.0, 91.2.0esr, and 78.15.0esr, as well as on Windows 10 x64, macOS 10.15, and Ubuntu 21.04.

When I follow the steps to reproduce the issue - which is simply opening Firefox, clicking on the ""Edit This Site"" button from the top sites section, and then hitting Esc - what actually happens is that the button remains selected instead of disappearing like it's supposed to when you're not hovering over it. This isn't a new problem, by the way - I've been able to reproduce this same behavior all the way back in Firefox 69.0a1 from May 2019, so it doesn't seem like this is a regression or anything.

I've attached a screen recording that shows what's going on if you want to take a look for yourself. Interestingly, I've also found that if you drag the ""Edit This Site"" button (or even the ""Open Menu"" button) around, you can reproduce this same issue - so it might be worth looking into why these two buttons are behaving in a similar way."

I managed to narrow down the problem using Mozregression to three changesets that landed at once - the last good one was [2705f924b635eb7a999e7b407c2beaedc584c175](https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/rev/2705f924b635eb7a999e7b407c2beaedc584c175) and the first bad one was [e08e703105231b0e270996dac0e0359db757644f](https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/rev/e08e703105231b0e270996dac0e0359db757644f)."

I expected it to close normally, but nope, it didn't even make it. The funny thing is that this happens in multiple versions of Firefox: nightly 124.0a1, beta 123.0b9, and release 122.0.1 - and it's not just a Windows thing, I also saw it on Mac and Linux (Mint 20.1).

""I've got a weird issue to report! So, I created an attachment called `testcase.html` and what happens is that if you allocate a ton of memory (which exhausts the process virtual memory) and then try to execute some invalid JavaScript code inside a try-catch block with a specific input pattern, Firefox 32-bit will crash on me. What's even stranger is that when I tried it on Firefox 64-bit, it crashed on different addresses every time - like `0x00050512fab2b080`, `0x000514975972b080`, and so on.

I've fine-tuned the `testcase.html` file to make it really reliable on Firefox 114.0.1 (32-bit) on Windows 11, and I can reproduce the crash consistently on both my Intel i9-13900k and AMD Ryzen 7 5700g machines. It also works on Firefox Nightly 116.0a1 (2023-06-16) (32-bit), but the success rate is a bit lower and I need to adjust some code to make it work reliably there.

Here are the details of what I tested:

* Firefox 114.0.1 (32-bit)
* Firefox 114.0.1 (64-bit)
* Firefox Nightly 116.0a1 (2023-06-16) (32-bit)

To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:

1. Open Firefox 114.0.1 (32-bit)
2. Visit the attached `testcase.html`
3. Wait about 20 seconds
4. The Firefox tab will crash
5. Use Windbg to analyze the minidump and see that it crashes on `js_getproperty` -> `js_forwardgetpropertyto`."

broken_darkening_of_window_control_buttons.png

#### steps to reproduce:
1. launch firefox (at least version 90.0 stable)
2. do basically anything that makes the new proton window modal appear, e.g. click: application menu > help > troubleshoot mode.
3. look at the top right corner of the firefox window and see what is described in the ""actual results"" section.

#### actual results:
the window minimize, maximize, and close buttons are no longer susceptible to the new proton window-modal darkening (see attached screenshot).

#### expected results:
the window control buttons should become darker when the new proton window modal is displayed, as in version 89.0 stable.

#### additional context:
if i understood everything correctly, the story here is as follows:
1. when proton was introduced in firefox 89.0, the window minimize, maximize, and close buttons were displayed correctly and were susceptible to the new proton window-modal darkening.
2. changes made to fix bug 1696905 broke the window control buttons on windows 8.1 and made them appear as a black rectangle.
3. to fix this regression (i.e. bug 1709535), some changes was made. they actually fixed it — the black rectangle disappeared — but the initial correct behavior from point 1. above (i.e. to darken also the window controls when the new proton window modal is displayed) has not been restored, unfortunately.

unfortunately, due to the black rectangle in windows 8.1, i were not able to check whether the darkening of the window minimize, maximize, and close buttons has been broken when trying to fix bug 1709535, or maybe earlier — when trying to fix bug 1696905.",Best,15,16,93.75,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,False,0,False,0,True,2,True,1,True,1,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,2,"Here's a rewritten version of the bug report in a natural, conversational tone:

So, I've got a weird issue with Firefox. When I launch the browser and then click on the help menu to get into troubleshoot mode (just one example - it happens whenever that new Proton window modal pops up), something strange happens. Instead of the usual darkening effect on the minimize, maximize, and close buttons in the top right corner of the window, they just freeze as black rectangles like this [attachment 9232191: broken_darkening_of_window_control_buttons.png]. What I'm expecting is that those buttons should get darker when the Proton modal shows up, just like it did before (in Firefox 89.0, specifically). It seems like some changes made to fix another bug broke this behavior on my Windows 8.1 machine, and now we're stuck with these weird black rectangles instead of the nice darkening effect."

steps to reproduce:

i created a small test case to show that scroll events stop working if a synchronous xhr request is startet while scrolling an iframe.

in the test case there is a scroll listener that logs the current y scroll position, each time you scroll. also there is a simple xhr request, started after 5s timeout.
if you keep on scrolling while the request is started you can see that the listener stops to log the y position. there is also no error on the console. 
if you do not scroll while the the request is started (only before and after), everything works as expected.
see video and test case package. this behavior/bug was introduced with firefox 66.

steps:
- open https://codesandbox.io/s/hardcore-lamport-1l11b or attached zip file (local webserver)
- open native firefox dev tools / console
- keep scrolling
-- you will see logs of your scroll position until the request after 5s is started

steps to reproduce:

running libcacard tests under valgrind:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/libcacard/-/issues/15

this points to the use of `flagseries` and `flagstate` members, which are not initialized during the structure initialization and first tested in `secmod_handlewaitforslotevent` (and value is assigned to them only after the first test). i believe the correct fix is to make sure they are initialized when the structure is allocated otherwise it might cause unexpected behavior.

this is available in the master.

test case with input field at the bottom

this is a follow-up to bug 1828235.

when an input field is placed low enough on a page it is hidden by the dynamic toolbar after tapping into it. a possible fix could be to forcefully hide the toolbar in such scenarios.

* ensure ""scroll to hide toolbar"" is enabled
* ensure the dynamic toolbar is visible and not hidden through scrolling
* tap the input to focus the input element

actual results:
* the input field ends underneath the dynamic toolbar such that it is not visible

Hey, so I wanted to follow up on an issue we previously reported (bug 1828235). Anyway, here's what's happening: when there's an input field at the bottom of a page and you tap into it, the dynamic toolbar just covers it up.

To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:

* Make sure ""scroll to hide toolbar"" is turned on
* Make sure the dynamic toolbar is visible and not hidden by scrolling down or up
* Tap into the input field to focus it

So, when I do all that, what happens is that the input field gets cut off at the bottom of the screen because the dynamic toolbar covers it. That's not what should happen - I expected the input field to be fully visible.

According to the documentation, there should be some space between the rows of text, but instead, it's way larger than it should be. It gets even weirder because this issue also affects the ""import error"" modal. And get this - it seems like this problem was introduced as a fix for bug 1701690 (not that I'm complaining about the original fix or anything). Anyways, I attached a screenshot showing the difference between what's supposed to happen and what actually happens - thought you might find it helpful!"

steps to reproduce:

i'm using a smart card certificate for authentication to a website.
it seems like i've used the ""remember this decision"" feature before.

everything was working fine, but i've recently renewed my expiring smart card certificate.

whenever i visit this website now, i immediately get a ssl_error_expired_cert_alert error. i don't get a prompt asking me which certificate to use.


actual results:

looks like firefox was using a now-expired certificate -- some remembered decision from before.

it didn't provide a prompt telling me that there are other options (i do have a renewed certificate on this smart card now).

it didn't point me to settings > privacy & security > view certificates > authentication decisions, where i could manage such remembered decisions.

in any case, going to settings > privacy & security > view certificates > authentication decisions, i didn't see any remembered decisions that i could clear.

i have ended up manually deleting entries from the `clientauthrememberlist.txt` file in my profile directory, which solved the problem.


expected results:

i expect that firefox would notice that this certificate is expired and bring the ""prompt"" again, despite me having said ""remember this decision"" some few years ago.

i also expect that whenever an error like ssl_error_expired_cert_alert (or similar) happens, firefox would bring up a prompt asking for another certificate. authentication has obviously failed, so it should provide other options instead of insisting on this.

it may have also told me about such remembered decisions and point me to settings > privacy & security > view certificates > authentication decisions, so i can edit these decisions.

in any case, i would have expected that the ""authentication decisions"" feature worked. it seems like it currently doesn't list anything.

----

seems like this is 2 issues in one:

- (bug) ""authentication decisions"" showed nothing, while there were obviously some remembered decisions, which i could clear manually from `clientauthrememberlist.txt`

- (enhancement) improving the current behavior -- selecting an expired certificate and not giving me other options or guides, but merely an `ssl_error_expired_cert_alert` error is not friendly","**Content:**
The bug report provides a clear description of the issue, including steps to reproduce, expected results, and actual results. The issue is well-defined, and it's easy to understand what happened.

**Grammar:**
The grammar is generally good, with minor issues such as:

* Minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., inconsistent indentation)
* Some sentences are a bit long and could be broken up for better readability
* A few words or phrases could be rephrased for improved clarity

However, overall, the writing is clear and easy to understand.

""I'm using Firefox 89.0 on Linux, and I've run into a weird issue with smart card certificates. So, I use a smart card for authentication to a specific website, and I've got 'remember this decision' enabled because it's a hassle to input my credentials every time. Everything was working smoothly until I renewed my expiring certificate - now whenever I visit that website, Firefox gives me an SSL error saying the certificate is expired. The weird part is that I don't get prompted to choose which certificate to use; instead, it just shows me the error message.

What's even weirder is that I think this issue is related to some remembered decision from before. Apparently, Firefox was still using my old, expired certificate and didn't offer any alternatives or hints about what was going on. I had to manually go into settings > privacy & security > view certificates > authentication decisions to clear out the remembered decisions - and even then, there were none listed!

What I expect is that when an error like this happens, Firefox should realize the certificate's expired and give me the option to choose a new one. It should also provide some guidance on how to fix the issue or manage my remembered decisions. Instead, it just showed me the error message and didn't offer any help.

It seems like there are two issues here: (1) 'authentication decisions' is broken and doesn't show anything, even though I can clear out remembered decisions manually; and (2) when an expired certificate's used, Firefox should provide a more friendly experience, like offering alternative certificates or guiding me to fix the issue."

i use firefox 96.0.1 on linux mint (i also tested this behaviour with firefox 96.0.1 from https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release).
the option ""pdfjs.enablepermissions"" is enabled, even if it is disabled in policies.json on linux (when the ""enabled: true"" option is not used).

steps to reproduce:
1. set /etc/firefox/policies/policies.json to
{
  ""policies"": {
    ""pdfjs"": {
      ""enablepermissions"": false
    }
  }
}

2. start firefox (i used a new profile)

3. see about:policies#active that option is correctly recognized and set to false.


--- 
other possibilities to define:
when setting /etc/firefox/policies/policies.json to the following:
{
  ""policies"": {
    ""pdfjs"": {
      ""enabled"": false,
      ""enablepermissions"": false
    }
  }
}
the value ""pdfjs.enablepermissions"" in about:config is locked and true (as pdfjs is correctly disabled, this has no impact). this was just to test when this bug occurs, so you can easier find the cause.

setting the option ""pdfjs.enablepermissions"" in the preferences, correctly works as expected:
{
  ""policies"": {
    ""preferences"": {
      ""pdfjs.enablepermissions"": {
        ""value"": false,
        ""status"": ""locked""

{
  ""policies"": {
    ""pdfjs"": {
      ""enabled"": true,
      ""enablepermissions"": false
    }
  }
}



actual results:

check the value ""pdfjs.enablepermissions"" in about:config.
for me, this option is locked and true.
i also verified the permission with an example pdf (https://h24-files.s3.amazonaws.com/65073/161759-fduyc.pdf) and i cannot copy text.

3. **Actual Result (AR)**: What actually happened is described.

The report also includes relevant information, such as:

* Software version and build number
* Operating system and environment
* Additional details about the testing process

However, there are a few minor issues:

* The report could benefit from more concise language in some sections.
* It would be helpful to summarize the main issue in the introduction (e.g., ""The 'pdfjs.enablepermissions' option is not being disabled when set in policies.json"").

Overall, this is a good bug report!",15,16,93.75,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,True,1,True,1,True,2,False,0,False,0,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,2,"Here's a rewritten version of the bug report in a conversational tone:

""I'm experiencing an issue with Firefox 96.0.1 on Linux Mint (also tested on the official Mozilla release). When I set 'pdfjs.enablepermissions' to false in the `/etc/firefox/policies/policies.json` file, it doesn't actually disable the option. Instead, when I check about:policies#active, it shows that the option is correctly recognized and set to false - but if I go to about:config, it's still locked and set to true. This means I can't copy text from PDFs (tested with this example file: https://h24-files.s3.amazonaws.com/65073/161759-fduyc.pdf). To reproduce the issue:

1. Set `/etc/firefox/policies/policies.json` to `{ ""policies"": { ""pdfjs"": { ""enablepermissions"": false } } }`
2. Start a new Firefox profile
3. Check about:policies#active to see that the option is correctly set to false

The weird thing is, if I explicitly enable or disable 'pdfjs.enablepermissions' in about:config, it works as expected - so it's only when setting this option through the policies file that it gets stuck. On a related note, if I set `enabled` and `enablepermissions` both to false in the policies file, it does work correctly. And if I set 'pdfjs.enablepermissions' directly in the preferences, it also works as expected. But for some reason, setting it through the policies file keeps 'pdfjs(enablepermissions locked and true.' That's what I'm trying to report - the actual result is that 'pdfjs.enablepermissions' is stuck at true when set through the policies file."""

So, I've been testing out Firefox beta 100.0 on both Windows 10 and Mac OS 11.6.2, and I found this weird issue that I wanted to report. To reproduce it, you need to have a Firefox build with an en-* locale (whatever that means), a profile older than 28 days, and the browser not pinned to the taskbar or dock. Oh, and you also need to save this specific ""user.js"" file on your computer - don't ask me why, but it's required for some reason! 

To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: open Firefox with that old profile, navigate to its folder and paste in the ""user.js"" file, restart the browser, focus the ""browser console"", and then just observe what happens. What I saw was a bunch of errors popping up - not exactly what I expected! 

Normally, when you do this, you should be enrolled in some experiment without any issues. But instead, I got a validation error saying it didn't work out. Weird, right?

steps to reproduce:

i noticed this on google meet, but the issue is reproducible for me on any site that records audio.

steps to reproduce:
1. use firefox beta (122.0b9 in my case)
2. visit https://online-voice-recorder.com . the issue isn't specific to this site, but it's easy to show the problem.
3. click record and use the apple studio display microphone.

5. play back the audio in the browser, or download the file.

this issue happens consistently in firefox beta, even in ""safe mode"" and a clean profile. i've also reinstalled the app (overwrite `/applications/firefox.app`) and the issue persists.

So, I was trying to open this PDF file (I attached it to this report - it's from the Chronicles Systems website) and when I viewed it in Firefox on my Windows 10 laptop, the splash image just took over the whole page! It covers up some of the other content, which is kind of frustrating. But when I opened it in Google Chrome or Adobe Acrobat Pro, the image was only displayed behind the ""C"" logo, which is how I think it's supposed to be. I'm guessing this could happen with other PDFs too, but I don't have any other examples handy. Anyway, my main issue is that the big image overpowers everything else in Firefox - it should just be cropped to a specific area on the page like it is when you view it correctly."

I was messing around with this SVG file (attachment 9217699, arrangement.svg) and noticed something weird. I opened it up no problem, and everything looked as expected.

It's like the scaling information from the viewbox gets completely ignored while printing, but magically works just fine when you're viewing it normally on screen. What I'm expecting instead is for those SVG use elements to scale along with everything else when printing, so they don't look all squished or distorted."

bookmark suggestion shown in 117.0a1, but in wrong section

### steps to reproduce

1. start with a clean profile
2. go to ""settings"" -> ""search"" -> disable ""show search suggestions"" (disabling it only for private browsing mode is sufficient to reproduce it in pb mode)
3. open website, e.g. ""example.org"", in private browsing mode (so that there will be no history entry)
4. add website as bookmark
5. close tab
6. in a new (private browsing) tab start typing ""example"" into url bar

### expected behavior
bookmarked website should show up as suggestion

### actual behavior
in most cases, no suggestions are shown. sometimes the bookmarked website is shown but is listed as google search result (see attached screenshot).
it does work correctly when either
- there is any history entry that matches the search string
- search browsing history is disabled
- bookmarks search engine is selected
- search suggestions are enabled

### device information

* firefox version: 115.2.1, 116.0b8, 117.0a1
* android device model: pixel 4a
* android os version: 13

### any additional information?
i think this is a regression in 115. this is an annoying issue when you are always using only private browsing mode.","Here's my assessment:

What's even weirder is that sometimes, instead of the actual bookmarked site, Google search results pop up - see the screenshot attached for an example. The only times this weirdness doesn't happen are when there's already some matching history entry, or if I disable searching my browsing history, or if I choose the bookmarks search engine, or if search suggestions are actually enabled in the first place.

I recently discovered an out-of-bounds access vulnerability in Firefox's WebGL implementation. Specifically, it affects the `glvminterpretfptransformfour` function when handling the `drawelements` command.

To reproduce this issue, you can follow these steps: open a test file called `poc.html` using Firefox (version 105.0.3) on my Mac running macOS Monterey 12.6 with an M1 Pro chip. Just wait for about a few seconds and the browser process will crash.

From my debugging analysis, it looks like the problem occurs in the OpenGLMT thread when trying to access memory at address `0x1715efff8`. When I looked deeper into the code, I found that the crash happens in the `glvminterpretfptransformfour` function.

The proof-of-concept file is attached for your reference. To trigger the bug, simply open the test HTML file and wait a few seconds - you should see the browser process crash.

steps to reproduce:

i tried filling a company pdf-form, and in the firefox pdf viewer it rendered perfectly. i then tried to print it, and in the preview the size of my input was enlarged, which seemed kind of odd.

i decided to try filling out the pdf in adobe acrobat, but the error still persisted.

the weird thing is, that if my cache is clear and i download the pdf without opening it in the firefox-pdf viewer, the input is not enlarged. so the problem seems to be with the pdf-viewer.

""So, I've been having this weird issue with PDF forms in Firefox. When I try to fill out a company PDF form using the built-in viewer, everything looks good and normal. But when I go to print it, the size of my input is suddenly enlarged - it's like it's being magnified or something! And the craziest part is that this has happened on multiple versions of Firefox in our office (87 and up). I thought maybe it was just a one-time thing, but nope, it persists. Even when I try filling out the form in Adobe Acrobat, the issue still shows up. What's really weird though is that if I clear my cache and download the PDF without opening it in Firefox first, the input size is fine. So, it seems like the problem lies with the PDF viewer itself. My expectation was that my input would be rendered correctly while filling out the form and not enlarged when printing. If you need the actual PDF file to reproduce this issue, I can send it over, but I figured these screenshots (attachment 9232100) might be more helpful in illustrating the problem."""

**affected platforms:**
seems like macos only, reproduced on 10.15, 10.13
not reproducible on windows 7/10 or linux

**steps to reproduce:**
1. have your browser region set to allow cc autofill, ex: us

3. go to https://luke-chang.github.io/autofill-demo/basic_cc.html
4. click on any of the fields (except csc)

**expected result:**
the cc dropdown should be displayed upon clicking on any of the mentioned fields.

only a blank white/black square is displayed on the first click and nothing on the second.

**regression-range:**
this is a regression but i can't find a reliable mozregression pushlog, it is always different, and by checking the first releases without builds for the suspected regressor it did not confirm that it worked before. tentatively marking regression-windowswanted but this is very shady to mozregress. it definitely used to work but something broke it for macos.","**good**

Instead of seeing all your available cards when you click on a field, it just shows a blank white/black square - and then nothing at all on the second click. This only happens on Mac OS (I tested 10.15 and 10.13) and not on Windows or Linux. I'm pretty sure this used to work fine before, but something must have broken recently because I've tried checking older versions and it doesn't seem to be a new feature that's causing the problem - it just stopped working altogether.

steps to reproduce:

on windows, with the wacom tablet driver installed (but no actual wacom tablet attached/used, just navigating with mouse):

* open https://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/pointer-hover-any-pointer-any-hover/
* review how the various interaction media features (pointer, hover, any-pointer, any-hover) are evaluated


actual results:

when the wacom driver is installed on windows, even if there isn't an actual wacom tablet attached (just navigating with the mouse as normal), firefox seems to get confused and evaluates the following (as if there was only a touch interface present):

pointer:coarse true
pointer:fine false
hover:none true
hover:hover false
any-pointer:coarse true
any-pointer:fine false
any-hover:none true
any-hover:hover false




expected results:

the mere presence of the wacom tablet driver (without a tablet attached) should have no impact on the interaction media features. so i'd expect simply

pointer:coarse false
pointer:fine true
hover:none false
hover:hover true
any-pointer:coarse false
any-pointer:fine true
any-hover:none false
any-hover:hover true

once a tablet is attached, i'd generally expect firefox to still choose/decide that the mouse is the primary input device - so pointer and hover should evaluate the same as above, but have any-pointer:coarse true:

pointer:coarse false
pointer:fine true
hover:none false
hover:hover true
*any-pointer:coarse true*
any-pointer:fine true

any-hover:hover true

at a stretch, if firefox is keen to see the tablet (once present) as the primary input, then at the very least i'd expect

*pointer:fine false*
*hover:none true*
*hover:hover false*
*any-pointer:coarse true*
*any-pointer:fine true*
any-hover:none false

note that uninstalling the wacom tablet driver and restarting the machine, firefox then shows the correct/expected results (for a mouse-driven machine).

compare this to chrome on windows, which behaves correctly with the driver installed (have not tested what happens with actual wacom tablet attached though, but from memory it behaves like the above ""once a tablet is attached"" scenario.","Here's my evaluation:

I noticed something weird when I had the Wacom driver installed on my Windows machine, even though I wasn't actually using a Wacom tablet (just navigating with my mouse). When I opened this website - https://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/pointer-hover-any-pointer-any-hover/ - which shows how different interaction media features are evaluated, Firefox got confused. It started acting like there was only a touch interface present, evaluating the media features as if that were true.

Here's what it did:

* pointer: coarse, fine (both false)
* hover: none, hover (both true)
* any-pointer: coarse, fine (both false)
* any-hover: none, hover (both true)

I expected Firefox to behave normally, without the Wacom driver messing things up. But once I uninstalled the driver and restarted my machine, everything went back to normal.

The weird thing is that Chrome doesn't have this issue - even with the Wacom driver installed, it behaves correctly (at least, as far as I remember). It's like Firefox thinks there's a touch interface present just because the Wacom driver is installed, even when no tablet is attached."

the problem was detected directly after issuance by our post-issuance linting.

issuance was not prevented because: 
-	the verification team approved the subject dn without resolving the error as indicated by the administration system. the administration system compares the st field to the country subdivisions in a pre-approved list based on iso 3166. the override is available in the event there is a difference of the verified st field and the pre-approved list.
-	no check was implemented in pre-issuance linting which is based on zlint. 

> 7.    list of steps your ca is taking to resolve the situation and ensure such issuance will not be repeated in the future, accompanied with a timeline of when your ca expects to accomplish these things.

the certificate request system is being migrated to complete the st field based on a drop down  populated by the pre-approved list. the system which had the issue has not yet been migrated. the migration will be complete by 15 december 2022.

We first noticed an issue on September 15th, 2022 at 12:01 UTC when our post-linting check picked up that a TLS certificate was issued with a state or province value that wasn't on our pre-approved list. Here's what happened next:

This system compares the ST field to a pre-approved list based on ISO 3166, and we didn't have a check in place during pre-issuance linting.

To fix this situation and prevent it from happening again, we're taking the following steps:

* We're migrating our certificate request system to require the ST field to be populated from a dropdown menu with our pre-approved list
* We've escalated guidance to our verification team on reviewing and correcting this field if needed

I've got a weird issue where when I capture an element using Firefox 88.0 on Ubuntu, the alignment is totally off.

Hey, I'm experiencing this weird issue with Firefox beta and nightly builds on Windows 10, macOS 10.15.7, and Linux Ubuntu 20.04. So, here's what's going on: when I have session restore enabled and the ""about:preferences"" page open (not just the search pane), I can reproduce this bug by setting some specific preferences (like enabling quick suggest and online scenario). After restarting Firefox, clicking the ""customize in settings"" button from the onboarding modal doesn't redirect me to the already open ""about:preferences"" page with the search pane focused like it should. Instead, it takes me to the sync pane. And get this - when I click that button, there are some errors popping up in the browser console about a lazy browser prematurely inserted via 'loaduri' property access and a TypeError saying I can't access the ""gotopref"" property because `browser.contentwindow` is null (the error message varies slightly depending on whether I'm using the beta or nightly build). Anyway, I've attached a screen recording of this issue, so you can see it in action for yourself."

[summarizing up to comment 18 -dveditz] this user had a legacy cookie permission in the site permissions database that broke the ""manage exceptions"" dialog for cookies -- it simply wouldn't appear. this was because one of their cookies permissions, apparently added in 2017, had a capability of `9` which was formerly used for access_allow_first_party_only. as a result the localization routine threw an exception (see comment 5) because it only expected values `0`, `1`, and `2`. this exception was not caught which nerfed the dialog.

folks with old profiles, especially those who actively manage their cookies, might have any of several different obsolete values saved in the site permissions database. that should not break the management dialogs!  it looks like the network code ignores cookie permission entries with unexpected values so the simple solution would be to likewise simply ignore those entries and don't display them in the dialog. or you could proactively delete invalid entries.

===== original bug entry: ======
user agent: mozilla/5.0 (macintosh; intel mac os x 10.14; rv:90.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/90.0

steps to reproduce:

i went to about:preferences#privacy and clicked the button ""manage exceptions"" in the cookies section


actual results:

nothing


expected results:

a dialog window should have opened that lists all cookie exceptions. i use this feature relatively frequently and it never had any issues. but now when i click the button, nothing happend. all the other buttons on the page work normally.

i also notice that after clicking the ""manage exceptions"" button, i can't scroll the page any more. i have to navigate to some other page and then back to make it work again.","Here's my evaluation:

**Content:** Good
The bug report provides a clear summary of the issue, its cause, and potential solutions. The user also mentions their own experience with the feature, which helps to illustrate the impact of the bug.

**Grammar:** Best
The text is well-written and easy to understand. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that would detract from the report's clarity.

As for the required sections:

1. **Steps to Reproduce (S2R):** Good
The user provides a clear, concise description of how to reproduce the issue.
2. **Expected Result (ER):** Good
The expected result is clearly stated, allowing developers to understand what the user intended to happen.
3. **Actual Result (AR):** Good
The actual result is also well-described, helping developers to understand the problem.

4. **Additional Information:** Good
The report includes relevant details such as software version and build number, which can be helpful for debugging.

Overall, I would rate this bug report as ""Best"" because it provides a clear summary of the issue, its cause, and potential solutions, along with well-written steps to reproduce and expected results.",14,16,87.5,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,False,0,False,0,True,2,False,0,True,1,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,2,"Here's a rewritten version of the bug report in a natural, conversational tone:

""I was trying to manage my cookie exceptions on Firefox, but when I clicked the 'Manage Exceptions' button under the Cookies section in Preferences > Privacy, nothing happened! Usually, this opens up a dialog window showing all the cookie exceptions I've set up. But now, it just doesn't show up at all.

What's even weirder is that after clicking the button, I couldn't scroll the page anymore - it was like the whole thing froze. I had to navigate away and then back to get scrolling working again. 

It turns out that one of my old cookie permissions from 2017 has an outdated capability value (it's a `9` instead of one of the usual `0`, `1`, or `2`). This is causing some localization routine to throw an exception, which isn't getting caught and is basically breaking the dialog. I'm guessing that other people with older profiles might have similar issues if they're actively managing their cookies.

The solution seems pretty simple: just ignore those old, outdated permission entries and don't display them in the dialog. Or, we could proactively delete any invalid entries to keep things working smoothly."""

Hey team, I'm reporting an issue that's been driving me nuts! I've got Firefox 91.0.2 installed on Windows 10, macOS 11.4.2, and Ubuntu Linux 20.04, with Normandy Devtools add-on enabled. The setup is a bit specific, though: I need to have a disabled recipe created beforehand. 

Here's what happens when I reproduce the bug: I open Firefox with the profile from before, enable the Normandy Devtools, log in with my credentials, switch to ""stage"" environment, and then load a disabled recipe. Next, I fire up the Network Monitor (Ctrl+Shift+E) and click the Enable button at the top right corner of the page. What I expect is that the recipe should get enabled after about 10 minutes, and show up in the ""main/normandy-recipes-capabilities"" collection. But instead, I get a 500 Server Error displayed in the Network Monitor, and the recipe remains unavailable.

I've attached a recording of this weirdness, which might help illustrate the issue better. Oh, and here's an interesting tidbit: if I refresh the Normandy Devtools page, the recipe suddenly appears as ""enabled"". The recipe used for this test is #1461, by the way. What's even more curious is that I had just disabled and re-enabled recipe #1460 without any issues, but when I tried it with recipe #1431, I hit this Server Error for the first time.

So, I'm trying to set up a new CardDAV address book in TB 91, but it's not working as expected. First, I went to Address Book > File > New > CardDAV Address Book, and followed the prompts to enter the address book name and URL (""https://domain.com/carddav/""). When prompted for my username and password, I entered them.

The issue is that TB failed to recognize the address books. I got some error messages in the console that said something about internal dialogs not being available in this context, and then it showed a prompt asking me to enter my credentials again.

What was supposed to happen was that TB would detect two address books - one read-only and one regular. Instead, it didn't even recognize them. We're using SabreDAV 4.1.5 for CardDAV (part of the GroupOffice Suite), and the address books are located at these URLs: ""https://domain.com/carddav/addressbooks/my.email@domain.com/347/"" and ""https://domain.com/carddav/addressbooks/my.email@domain.com/376/"".

I tried entering different URLs, but it only worked when I entered the direct URL of one of the address books (""https://domain.com/carddav/addressbooks/my.email@domain.com/347/""). Even then, it failed to sync any contacts. When I tried to set up a read-only address book, it wouldn't sync my contacts at all - even after trying a few times."

testcase #1

**steps to reproduce**
1. load the attached testcase

**actual results**
the borders of the first two boxes are rendered incorrectly. they should render exactly the same as the third box.

**expected results**
all three boxes render exactly the same as the third box currently does.

**additional information**
the third box has `border-image-width: 1` (the initial value) which should be used as a factor of `border-width` which is explicitly specified as `27px`, so the used value for `border-image-width` is `27px`.

the first box has an explicit `border-image-width: 27px`.
the second box has an explicit `border-image-width: auto` which means we should use the `border-image-slice` value instead which is specified (for all three boxes) to be `27px`.
so the `border-image-width` used value should be `27px` for these two boxes too.

spec:
https://drafts.csswg.org/css-backgrounds-3/#the-border-image-width

fwiw, all three boxes look the same in chrome, but note that they have implemented `border-image-repeat: space` incorrectly. spec:
https://drafts.csswg.org/css-backgrounds-3/#valdef-background-repeat-space


btw, i printed out the numbers we calculate here:

The report is well-structured, easy to follow, and provides all necessary information for debugging the issue.",14,16,87.5,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,True,1,True,1,True,2,False,0,True,1,True,2,True,2,True,2,False,0,"Here's the rewritten bug report:

I created an attachment (9224382) and tested it - when I loaded the attached file, I noticed that the borders of the first two boxes didn't look right compared to the third box. Specifically, their borders were rendered incorrectly, whereas the third box had its borders displayed perfectly. What I'm expecting is that all three boxes should have exactly the same border styling as the third one currently has. 

Here's what's going on: the third box uses the initial value of `border-image-width` (1) which gets multiplied by the explicitly set `border-width` of 27px, so it looks fine. The first box has its `border-image-width` set to exactly 27px, which makes sense. And the second box is using the default value of `auto`, which means we should use the specified `border-image-slice` value of 27px instead. 

So, according to the spec (https://drafts.csswg.org/css-backgrounds-3/#the-border-image-width), all three boxes should have a used value for `border-image-width` of 27px. That's why I think it's weird that only the first two boxes are not rendering their borders correctly.

By the way, when I checked in Chrome, all three boxes do look the same - but keep in mind that this browser is also incorrectly implementing `border-image-repeat: space`, according to the spec (https://drafts.csswg.org/css-backgrounds-3/#valdef-background-repeat-space). 

Lastly, I double-checked the calculations we did for this issue and everything seems correct at this point (see https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/d3b116e554eb3546a95851e81f7ddc53d5b7e096/layout/painting/nscssrenderingborders.cpp#3845-3854)."

Ideally, I'd want the browser to just detect the 'content-security-policy' header and not display any warnings at all, or if it does display a message, it should clearly state that the 'x-frame-options' header will be ignored only if it's present (which it isn't in this case). As it stands, this warning might lead some people on a wild goose chase trying to figure out what's going on with these headers."""

""I ran into an issue where if I post a message with a large local file (over 100KB) to a service worker, and don't reference the file at all from that side, I start seeing unreported blocks accumulating every time. Specifically, when I go to this test page - https://vul3vm06.github.io/post-file-to-sw/ - I noticed that a bunch of unreported blocks keep showing up in the dump. It seems like there's some sort of leak going on because these blocks just keep piling up and never get cleared out. What's even weirder is that the refcnt for this nspipe object stays at 3, which means it never gets deleted. So, my expectation is that when I post this file, no unreported blocks should accumulate and the nspipe should be deleted properly."""

Finally, choose 'clear form' for the cardholder name field. What should happen is that all eligible credit card fields should be cleared, with a dropdown menu showing up to let you do that. But what actually happens is that only the cardholder name field gets cleared, and the dropdown only shows up for that one field too.

reproduction steps (see attached mp4 screencast):

""I'm following up on an earlier issue (bug 1706652) where we decided that when the existing users onboarding modal is displayed, the browser's close button would remain active on Macs. So, if you click the close button while the onboarding modal is up, it shouldn't actually close the browser - instead, it should add the ""close tabs and exit?"" confirmation message to the queue until you dismiss the onboarding modal. I'm reporting this because I've noticed that on Firefox beta 89.0b2 (build id: 20210420191345) and Firefox nightly 90.0a1 (build id: 20210421212740), running on macOS 10.15.7 or 11.2.3, the behavior doesn't match what we expected.

So, I'm trying to reproduce this weird behavior with Firefox, and it seems to happen on three different platforms: Windows 10, Linux Mint 20, and macOS 11.1. The versions of Firefox involved are beta 90.0b6 (build id: 20210610185818) and nightly 91.0a1 (build id: 20210610215038). 

To get to the issue, I need a few things set up first. I have to create a Normandy default type recipe that sets some preferences with non-default values - think of it like a special experiment mode for Firefox. For example, I'd set ""browser.topsites.experiment.ebay-2020-1"" to true. Then, I need a user.js file that enrolls me in this experiment. 

To reproduce the bug, I follow these steps: First, I head to ""about:config"" and create those same preferences with experiment values (like setting ""browser.topsites.experiment.ebay-2020-1"" to true). Then, I restart Firefox. Next, I go to the profile directory folder, copy that user.js file from before, and then restart Firefox again. After that, I head back to ""about:studies"", unenroll from the study, and restart Firefox one more time. Finally, I go back to ""about:config"" and check out those preferences.

What I expected to happen was that all my preferences set before enrolling in the experiment would still be there after I unenrolled - essentially, they'd keep their user value. But what actually happens is that if those preferences have the same values as the ones used by that branch, they get deleted after unenrollment."

steps to reproduce:

this is a preliminary incident report. our investigation into this matter is ongoing. 

1. how your ca first became aware of the problem (e.g. via a problem report submitted to your problem reporting mechanism, a discussion in mozilla.dev.security.policy, a bugzilla bug, or internal self-audit), and the time and date. 

the issue was discovered by our validation team while performing a routine check of an ev tls order. 

2. a timeline of the actions your ca took in response. a timeline is a date-and-time-stamped sequence of all relevant events. this may include events before the incident was reported, such as when a particular requirement became applicable, or a document changed, or a bug was introduced, or an audit was done. 

- 2021-07-10t02:34:38-00:00 ev tls order reviewed and approved by one of our validation specialists. 
- 2021-07-12t03:38:36-00:00 customer care requests for an update on the abovementioned order. 
- 2021-07-12t09:15:41-00:00 the issuance of an ev tls certificate with serial number 776752935acf6697078d9cb5547921a6 is triggered with the invocation of an api call by one of our resellers. 
- 2021-07-13t16:05:00-00:00 in the process of performing 2p approval, one of our senior validation specialists determines that the certificate was issued without stored evidence of 2p approval in the system. the issue is reported by registering an internal ticket. 
- 2021-07-13t16:37:00-00:00 the ticket is processed with high priority by a senior software engineer. a bug is discovered in our api and a hotfix is immediately deployed. investigation continues to determine the population of the possibly affected certificates. 
- 2021-07-14t20:22:00-00:00 the population of possibly affected certificates is sought and determined to be eleven (11) ev tls certificates. 
- 2021-07-15t15:00:00-00:00 the issue is picked up by our security auditing department and investigation begins. 
- 2021-07-16t00:46:58-00:00 additional technical information is shared by the software engineers. 
- 2021-07-16t02:07:05-00:00 audit logs of the approvals of the abovementioned population are presented. security auditors initiate a detailed review to determine whether and for which exact certificates there is a lack of 2p approval evidence. 
- 2021-07-19t19:31:00-00:00 after detailed review of the abovementioned population by our security auditors and discussions with the validation team, two (2) additional problematic certificates are found. subsequent review confirms that validation evidence supported issuance for all three (3) affected certificates, however immediate revocation is requested due to the lack of 2p approval at the time of issuance. 
- 2021-07-19t21:56:00-00:00 all three (3) affected certificates revoked. 
- 2021-07-20t11:00:00-00:00 security auditors start gathering all the information and compiling a preliminary incident report. 
- 2021-07-23: filed initial bugzilla report. 

3. whether your ca has stopped, or has not yet stopped, issuing certificates with the problem. a statement that you have will be considered a pledge to the community; a statement that you have not requires an explanation. 

a hotfix was immediately deployed and tested after the issue was detected. no similar issuances can be performed currently. 

4. a summary of the problematic certificates. for each problem: number of certs, and the date the first and last certs with that problem were issued.  

three (3) ev tls certificates, issued between 2021-05-18 and 2021-07-12. 

5. the complete certificate data for the problematic certificates. the recommended way to provide this is to ensure each certificate is logged to ct and then list the fingerprints or crt.sh ids, either in the report or as an attached spreadsheet, with one list per distinct problem.  

impacted certificates (and their corresponding pre-certificates):

6. explanation about how and why the mistakes were made or bugs introduced, and how they avoided detection until now. 

the bug was introduced when the 2-person approval was migrated from the ca software to the ra portal on 2021-04-13. the purpose of this change was to allow full processing of validations in the ra portal by validation specialists.  

a faulty if check in the ra api code allowed issuance of ev tls certificates with a single person approval. the bug did not affect ev code signing or other types of certificates except ev tls . this issue also did not affect other validations performed via our ra portal; it was limited to our api, which is currently being used only by specific resellers for the issuance of a limited number of certificates. 

the bug passed undetected to the production systems despite the fact that the change was reviewed both within the development department (code review) and by the compliance department (change review). the issue was also not detected during our quarterly certificate reviews due to the low number of affected certificates. 

7. list of steps your ca is taking to resolve the situation and ensure such issuance will not be repeated in the future, accompanied with a timeline of when your ca expects to accomplish these things. 

immediate actions are described in steps 2-4 of this report and include the emergency deployment of the code fix to prevent further problematic issuances, the involvement of our internal auditing department, the thorough review of the possibly affected certificates and the revocation of the affected certificates after confirming the issue. 

initial review focuses on: 

- why the bug was introduced in the first place and in particular why it affected only ev tls certificates but not ev code signing, which follow the same 2p approval principle;
- how the issue was not detected during the code or compliance review, before reaching production.

our investigation is ongoing and analysis is being conducted to reveal any underlying weaknesses and, according to the results, decide any additional measures and improvements in our systems and processes, so that such occurrences are not repeated in the future. 

a full incident report shall be filed here when our investigation is complete. in the meantime, we will post regular updates.",Good,14,16,87.5,False,0,True,1,False,0,True,1,True,1,True,1,True,2,False,0,False,0,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,2,"Here's a rewritten version of the bug report in a natural, conversational tone:

So, here's what happened: our validation team discovered an issue with some EV TLS orders while doing a routine check. It turns out that between July 10 and July 12, we issued three EV TLS certificates without proper two-person approval. This was all due to a bug in our API code that allowed single-person approval for these types of certificates.

Here's what happened timeline-wise:

* On July 10, one of our validation specialists reviewed and approved an EV TLS order.
* On July 12, customer care asked us to update on the status of this order. Meanwhile, one of our resellers triggered the issuance of another EV TLS certificate.
* Later that day, a senior validation specialist noticed that the certificate was issued without stored evidence of two-person approval. We opened an internal ticket and started investigating.

We quickly deployed a hotfix to prevent further issuances with this problem. Our software engineers worked on fixing the bug, and we began reviewing all possibly affected certificates.

As it turned out, 11 EV TLS certificates were potentially impacted. We found that two more certificates had issues after doing a detailed review. We immediately revoked all three problematic certificates.

Here are some key details about these certificates:

* Three EV TLS certificates were issued between May 18 and July 12.
* The first certificate was issued on May 18, while the last one was issued on July 12.

As for how this mistake happened, it was due to a faulty IF check in our RA API code. This change was made back on April 13 to allow full processing of validations in the RA portal by validation specialists. The bug didn't affect EV code signing or other types of certificates except for EV TLS. It also didn't impact other validations performed via our RA portal.

The good news is that we've already taken steps to resolve this situation, including deploying the code fix, reviewing the possibly affected certificates, and revoking the problematic ones.

Looking ahead, we're focusing on understanding why this bug was introduced in the first place and how it went undetected during our regular code and compliance reviews. We'll use these findings to make sure such issues don't happen again in the future. Our investigation is ongoing, but I'll keep you posted with any updates!"

the toolbar has no ""translate"" icon, and there is no translations pop-up.

### device information
* firefox version: nightly 125.0a1 from 3/11
* android devices: google pixel 6 (android 14)

### any additional information?
* workaround: tap on the three-dot menu, then on the ""translate page"", and the pop-up is displayed, as in the short video attached.

### notes: 
* having a clean profile, and opening wikipedia.org - german, or a different language than en-us, triggers the first pop-up.
* having a clean profile, and opening elpais.com, does not trigger the first pop-up.","I'd rate this bug report as:

""I was testing Firefox 111 on Windows 10 and I found an issue with the form autofill/preview/clear feature.

When you click in any of the card number, cardholder, or expiration date fields, the form should behave as expected - it should preview all eligible fields, autofill them without highlighting, and provide a clear autofill option for each field. But what happens instead is that the form preview only works for the selected field, it's not highlighted in yellow like it should be; the fields are autofilled but not highlighted; and the clear autofill option only works for the selected field while the other fields don't display this option.

So, I've got a weird issue to report. When you create an element and add a drop shadow to it with both x and y offsets set to 0 and blur around 0.4rem, something funky happens in Firefox (specifically, version 100.0 on Linux). If the browser zoom is set to 100%, the shadow gets offset slightly up and left - like, you can't even notice it's there! I've attached a screenshot of what it looks like (testcase.html). Now, if you try this same thing in Chrome or Chromium, the shadow doesn't get offset at all (like, expected results), but if you zoom out a bit, the issue goes away.

expected results:

this structure should consist element ""body"", which must be there according to

I created an attachment to go along with this issue - [attachment 9247491](2021-10-25-thunderbird-calendar-event.jpg). It's weird, because I'm seeing some strange behavior when working with calendar events in Thunderbird. Here's what's happening: when I load the Add-ons panel and get a tab (using `messenger.tabs.query`) and an active message (`messenger.messagedisplay.getdisplayedmessage`), everything looks normal. But then, if I drill down to get the full data of the message using `messenger.messages.getfull(message.id)`, things start to go awry.

What's happening is that when I cycle through the parts array and try to show each part on the console (`console.log(onepart)`), I can see the structure of the parts (content type, headers, name, size, etc.), but sometimes the ""body"" element is missing - and it only happens when the content type is ""text/calendar"". What's even weirder is that there are error messages in the log saying something about not finding a file (FLE) - which seems related to timezone abbreviations used by Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook.

In some cases, if the message has a name set by the sender, I can use `messenger.messages.listattachments` to get the body of the calendar event. But in other cases, I have to resort to using `messenger.messages.getraw` and splitting it by boundaries to get the body - which is super wonky.

According to the documentation (https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/91/messages.html#messages-messagepart), I'm expecting this structure to include a ""body"" element, which seems like it should be there for innermost parts. Instead, it's just missing."

steps to reproduce:

* start firefox in arabic (right to left layout)
* click the application menu button, or on a button of an extension that displays a menu.



actual results:

menu is not displayed. sometimes the whole firefox crashes.

additional details:
* it worked for a while, but once it started crashing it became 100% reproducible.
* this was tested on a fresh installation of ubuntu 21.04, as well as a non-fresh installation of pop os 21.04, in wayland session for both.
* removing the entire ~/.mozilla folder does not help. reinstalling firefox also does not help.
* switching the language to english by simply running `lang=en firefox` solves the issue.
* switching to x11 seems to fix the issue as well.

should work and display the menu correctly.","Here's my evaluation:

When I start up Firefox in Arabic mode (which is basically a right-to-left layout), everything seems fine at first - until I try to open the application menu or click on a button that has a dropdown menu. That's when things go haywire: the menu doesn't show up, and sometimes the whole browser crashes! It's pretty consistent now, but weirdly enough, it used to work for a bit before this issue kicked in.

To be more specific, I've tried all sorts of troubleshooting stuff - reinstalled Firefox, removed my entire Mozilla folder (yeah, that's a thing), and even switched back to an English-only interface using the `lang=en firefox` command. And you know what? It fixes the problem! Same deal with switching back to X11 mode instead of Wayland. But as long as I'm stuck in Arabic mode, this issue persists.

steps to reproduce:

there is a bug with downloading canon’s cr3 files (raw image format).
if you download a cr3 file, firefox automatically change the file extension to .mp4 – instead of cr3.

you can reproduce it like this:

- download a cr3 file (for example here below: https://www.dkamera.de/testbericht/canon-eos-m6-mark-ii/beispielaufnahmen.html or here: https://www.dpreview.com/sample-galleries/3577431182/canon-rf-28-70mm-f2-l-sample-gallery-dpreview-tv/9300505795 – it is important, that you download the raw photo)

- save it

- you will find the file in your location with .mp4 instead of cr3

please also see the attached screenshot.

with canon's old file format .cr2, firefox does not have problems (you can test it here: https://www.dkamera.de/testbericht/canon-eos-70d/beispielaufnahmen.html or here: https://www.dpreview.com/sample-galleries/9485291827/canon-eos-5d-mark-iv-sample-gallery/7296166408 )

Hey, so I'm having an issue with Firefox (version 92) where some websites don't load properly when I have a certain preference enabled. Specifically, if I set `dom.script_loader.full_parse` to true and then load up some tabs with YouTube videos, Bugzilla bugs, and Phabricator reviews, things get wonky. Sometimes the pages will only partially load - think gray wireframes for YouTube, half-loaded Bugzilla bug layouts, or review pages that never actually show me the file diffs. It's like they're stuck in limbo! 

Here's what happens: sometimes the initial content loads just fine, but then it's like the dynamic parts get stuck. For instance, on a YouTube page, I'll see the gray wireframe with no video or comments; on Bugzilla, the layout shows up but none of the extra details expand; and on Phabricator, the review page looks right, but those file diff sections just say ""loading..."" forever.

The weird thing is that if I reload the page (Ctrl+R), everything usually loads just fine. And, get this - when it's not working, I see some errors in the console for Phabricator pages:

```
uncaught error: compileoptions mismatch between input and stencil <unknown>:1

screencast of the issue

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (x11; ubuntu; linux x86_64; rv:109.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/111.0

steps to reproduce:

i reproduce this on gnome desktop (wayland), at least on an up-to-date arch linux and ubuntu 22.10.

- move a non-maximized firefox window to the top edge of the screen
- try to interact with the tab bar (e.g. closing a tab with middle click, or left click on the new tab button) while having the mouse pointer at the very top of the screen


actual results:

the mouse actually interacts with the edge of the window, i.e. it starts to resize it.

if you right click there, the resizing will continue even if you release the mouse button. you need to left click to stop the resizing.


expected results:

the mouse should have interacted with the tab bar (pre-v111 behavior).","Here's my assessment:

* Content: Good
* Grammar: Best

The report has a clear structure and provides all necessary information to understand the issue. The steps to reproduce are detailed and specific, making it easy for developers to replicate the problem.

However, I do have some minor suggestions:

* Consider adding more context about what ""non-maximized Firefox window"" means (e.g., a window that's not maximized but still visible on the screen).
* You might want to rephrase the expected result to make it clearer what you expect to happen. For example: ""The mouse should interact with the tab bar instead of resizing the window.""
* The actual result is well-described, but consider adding more details about the behavior (e.g., how quickly the resizing starts, whether there's any animation involved).

Overall, your bug report is well-written and provides a good starting point for debugging!",15,16,93.75,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,True,1,True,1,True,2,False,0,True,1,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,1,"Here's the rewritten bug report in a natural, conversational tone:

Instead of letting me click on the tab bar, my mouse starts resizing the window! If I right-click there, it keeps going even after I release the button, and I have to left-click again to stop it.

ffdesyncsecure.js

steps to reproduce:

i am reporting a desynchronization issue between document.cookie and the actual content of the cookie jar in firefox. this report follows https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1782561, but i think these are two separate issues. similarly to the previous report, this inconsistency could introduce vulnerabilities in applications trusting the cookies read from document.cookie. in particular, this issue may allow same-site and network attackers to spoof the value of a cookie previously set as secure.

1. visit https://example.com
2. set a secure cookie using the console, e.g., document.cookie = ""test=secure; secure""
3. in the same tab, visit http://example.com
4. set an insecure cookie `test` to the value `insecure`: document.cookie = ""test=insecure""
5. force a refresh to http://example.com

a demo is available at https://ffdesyncsecure.minimal.blue/. nodejs sources are attached to this report. 


actual results:

step 4. sets the cookie `test=insecure` in document.cookie, altough a secure cookie with the same name (`test`) already exists. notice that the cookie `test=insecure` is not saved in the cookie jar by inspecting devtools storage -> cookies.
step 5. as expected, the `test` cookie is not attached in the request to http://example.com. at the same time, document.cookie still shows `test=insecure`.

the current behavior causes a desynchronization between document.cookie and the actual cookie jar of the browser.



expected results:

the document.cookie setter at step 4. should silently fail to set the cookie `test=insecure` due to the presence of a secure cookie with the same name. chromium-based browsers behave as expected, i.e., the cookie `test=insecure` does not populate document.cookie.","I'd rate this bug report as ""good"".

I'm reporting an issue where Firefox desynchronizes between what's shown in `document.cookie` and what's actually stored in the cookie jar.

The problem is that this inconsistency could lead to vulnerabilities in apps that trust the cookies read from `document.cookie`, especially since it might allow same-site or network attackers to spoof a secure cookie.

This means there's a desynchronization between what's shown in `document.cookie` and what's actually stored in the browser.

The expected behavior is that step 4 should silently fail to set the cookie `test=insecure` because there's already a secure cookie with the same name. Chrome-based browsers do this correctly, so it seems like Firefox has an issue here."

What I'm expecting to see is a slightly bigger radio button width, an underlined ""site not working?"" link, and all those section headers written in lowercase (like ""protection settings"" or ""tracking content""). The Figma specs should be followed here. And, of course, there should be some borders separating each section, with just a few pixels left at the edges - that's what I'm expecting to see.

But what I actually get is radio icons that are smaller than they should be, no underline on that ""site not working?"" link, and those section headers in uppercase instead of lowercase. And worst of all, those borders stretch all the way across the panel, which isn't right - it should leave some space at each side like the first border below the protection for a website does get it right.

I'm giving this bug a severity level of S2 because the permissions panel isn't fully styled for Proton yet. And just to confirm, I don't think this is a regression issue since it's been happening all along.

""I've been experiencing an issue with Firefox beta and nightly versions on Windows 10, macOS 11.1, and Linux Mint 20. If I open an older version of Firefox beta, update it to the latest build (I've tried 90.0b11 and 91.0a1), and then navigate to the ""about:support"" page, all the tables on that page are blank - nothing shows up. It's not just this page, though; I've also noticed the same issue with the ""about:studies"" page if I'm enrolled in an experiment before updating. The weird thing is that it only happens sometimes when using this page - maybe 1/3 of the time? But if I update from a previous version (like going from 88.0.1 to 89.0.2), the issue doesn't appear at all. I've attached a recording of the problem so you can see what's happening for yourself."""

So, I'm running into this weird issue with my super simple web extension in Firefox 86 on a Mac (don't know if it's specific to MacOS or not). What happens is that when I open the browser action popover, which has two child divs with some styling going on - `display: flex` and each div having `overflow: auto`.

microsec received an email based incident report to info@e-szigno.hu at tuesday, august 31, 2021 9:36 am

---

> ii -- a timeline of the actions your ca took in response. a timeline is a date-and-time-stamped sequence of all relevant events. this may include events before the incident was reported, such as when a particular requirement became applicable, or a document changed, or a bug was introduced, or an audit was done.

###### 2021-08-31 07:36 utc

- receive a notification email about the incorrectly issued tls certificate

###### 2021-08-31 08:27 utc

- microsec customer service officer processed the incoming email and opened an internal bug

###### 2021-08-31 08:42 utc

- initiating an investigation to identify the cause(s) of the error and to prevent further similar errors

###### 2021-08-31 09:54 utc

- contacting the site owner and informing them about the planned revocation

###### 2021-08-31 10:12 utc

- revocation of the incorrect certificate

---

> iii -- whether your ca has stopped, or has not yet stopped, issuing certificates with the problem. a statement that you have will be considered a pledge to the community; a statement that you have not requires an explanation.


the quick investigation confirmed that the current policy documents and certificate profiles are ok and that there is no need to suspend the certificate issuance.

---

> iv -- a summary of the problematic certificates. for each problem: number of certs, and the date the first and last certs with that problem were issued.

###### 2020-03-09

- one ov certificate with ecc key was issued with an incorrent key usage bit setting

---

| v2x-pki.com | https://crt.sh/?id=2730469679 |

---

> vi -- explanation about how and why the mistakes were made or bugs introduced, and how they avoided detection until now.

#### we performed the initial investigation and we found the following

###### 2018-04-21
- microsec installed an automatic check in the ca software which limits the usability of the different certificate profiles according to the type of the public key in the enduser certificate. the operation is based on a configuration file, which lists the allowed certificate profiles for a given key type in a given ica.

###### 2020-03-05
- version 2.13 of our public policies was released. this included the correct requirement for ku bits in case of ecc key.
- certificate profiles were updated according to the cp change to use version 2.13 cp oid values. certificate profiles included the appropriate ku setting for ecc based certificates.

###### 2020-03-09
- the ov certificate was issued under our rsa based ica ""e-szigno ssl ca 2014"", but for an ecc end-entity key.  microsec does not usually mix different key types, it was an exception event that we have issued a certificate for en ecc key from an rsa based ca hierarchy.
- the ro officer issued the certificate using the default rsa certificate profile
- the ca allowed the issuance of the certificate for the ecc key with an rsa certificate profile due to a configuration problem
- the certificate became faulty because an improper certificate profile was used for issuance, which resulted the incorrect ku setting
- the manual immediate post issuance quality control check did not recognize the fault


###### 2021-01-07
- microsec introduced the automatic cablint and zlint checks for each tls certificates which replaced the former manual checks.

###### 2020-2021
- microsec developed its certificate policy management system in two steps during 2020 and 2021. it results higher accountability and minimize the risk of misissuance.


#### summary of the findings

the misissuance was caused by a configuration problem in the certificate profile management system 
- ro officer selected the standard rsa based certificate profile for the ecc key in the rsa based ca (it is not her/his task to check the key type)
- the rsa based certificate profile was allowed for ecc keys in the rsa based ca due to a configuration problem (configuration fault)
- the certificate was issued with improper ku bits
- the manual immediate post issuance quality control check did not identify the problem
- the following quarterly quality control check did not select this specific certificate to re-check in april 2020

---

> vii -- list of steps your ca is taking to resolve the situation and ensure such issuance will not be repeated in the future, accompanied with a timeline of when your ca expects to accomplish these things.

#### immediate actions

- microsec revoked the affected ov tls certificate within 3 hours.
- microsec has verified all active certificate profiles, they were ok at the time of misissuance, and they are still ok.
- microsec has verified all active policy documents, they were ok at the time of misissuance and they are still ok.
- a quick initial investigation was made to find out the reason of the misissuance.
- microsec identified the causes of the misissuance as you see it above.
- microsec has verified the configuration of the certificate profiles in the ca software, it is ok.
- microsec checked all the valid certificates for this type of problem, there is no more certificate with this problem.
- microsec opened an incident bug in mozilla's bugzilla with the present report.


#### further planned actions

##### deadline: 2021-09-15

- microsec will check wether the present controls are sufficient to prevent a misissuance with this problem again.
- microsec will keep a training for the ro operators how to use the proper certificate profiles according to the type of the enduser key.

""I've been noticing an issue with Firefox's overscroll effect on my Mac, and I wanted to report it. It seems like when I scroll quickly using my trackpad or magic mouse, the animation feels snappy and not very natural - kind of like when you swipe too fast on your phone and everything jumps around instead of having that smooth, rubbery feel. I've compared this to Chrome and Safari, which both handle overscroll animations smoothly regardless of how fast I scroll, but Firefox just doesn't quite have the same polish. Even looking at recordings (I attached some examples - you can check out https://streamable.com/04gmms for a comparison with Chrome or https://streamable.com/kdncc0 for an example on Facebook), it's clear that there's something off about how Firefox handles fast swipe gestures.

steps to reproduce:

first open settings>>>composition and make sure the checkbox is filled/checked beside ""add link previews when pasting urls"". also make sure the dark theme is enabled. 

second, compose a new email and paste in a link/url. (preferably a link that has text appearing with it also, some links don't have much text appearing with the preview.) with the dark theme, the link preview has white text on off-white background.

the title of the link on the link preview is black on white, though the rest of the text is unreadable without a very close examination.

So, when I try to send big files (think bigger than 500KB) via WebSockets in Firefox, the browser just hangs and never sends the data. It works fine if the file is smaller though - weird, right? 

To reproduce this issue, you'll need to modify a script called ""websocket.js"" and set up a test server that accepts WebSocket requests (don't worry, it's not too hard to do with some Python bits). Then, just serve the folder using `python -m http.server` and visit localhost in your browser. Click on either of the buttons to create a WebSocket connection, load some binary data from a sample file I've attached, and send it over the socket. That's when you'll see Firefox hang if the file is too big.

According to my testing, this issue has been around since 2018 (yeah, that's weird - I'd have thought someone would have noticed by now!). The last good build was on November 6th, and the first bad one was on November 7th.

I was messing around with my Mac settings and decided to crank up the contrast to see if it would help me spot some annoying typos on a website. I opened up Firefox (version 91.0, just FYI) and went to the ""About Preferences"" menu, where I searched for the color settings and switched the ""Override"" option to ""Always"". This made all the colors go super bright and bold - kind of like when you're watching a TV in a dark room and someone turns up the brightness! Anyway, after that, I headed over to the ""About Addons"" page and disabled one of my favorite extensions. But here's the weird part: when I went back to try and re-enable it, the toggle to do so was completely gone! I was expecting to see that little checkbox or button, but it just wasn't there.

""I'm reporting an issue with print preview in Firefox that started happening after version 91.0.2 (20210823123856). Specifically, when I open Firefox, go to a website with multiple pages, and enter print preview mode, I notice that the scrollbar is wider than it should be. Normally, the scrollbar's dimensions match the one from the browser, but in this case, it looks like it's been stretched out or something. This only happens on Windows 10x64, and I've tried reproducing it on other platforms without success. To replicate the issue, just follow these steps: open Firefox, go to a website with multiple pages, enter print preview mode, and take a look at the scrollbar. You'll see what I mean - it's definitely wider than usual! I've attached a screenshot to help illustrate the problem.

### preconditions
1. perform at least a temporary search with the wikipedia and youtube topic-specific search engines and create some bookmarks. (to add youtube to the search engine list go to settings > search > + add search engine > select youtube and tap on the check mark in the right upper corner). 
2. go to settings > search engine. make sure that the ""search bookmarks"" option is enabled.

### steps to reproduce
1. tap on the dropdown menu from the google search engine icon. 
2. select the wikipedia topic-specific search engine.
3. type in a valid search term (related to the saved bookmarks previously created with the wikipedia search engine).
4. observe if search suggestions are displayed.
5. repeat steps 2-4 with the youtube topic-specific search engine selected. 

### expected behavior
temporary selected topic-specific search engines (amazon.com, ebay, wikipedia, reddit, youtube)  should display suggestions from the previously bookmarked searches made with the same search engine.

### actual behavior
temporary selected wikipedia and youtube topic-specific search engines do not display suggestions from the previously bookmarked searches made with the same search engine.

* firefox version: nightly 114.0a1 from 05/03
* android device model: lenovo yoga tab 11,  google pixel 7
* android os version: android 11, android 13

### any additional information?
- when searching for bookmarks in settings > bookmarks menu, the expected search results are displayed. 

- if the user is signed in with the same firefox account on multiple devices (e.g. mobile and desktop) and wikipedia and youtube bookmarks are created on desktop, they will be displayed as bookmarks suggestions in step 4, while the bookmarks created on the mobile device will still not be displayed.","I would rate this bug report as:

steps to reproduce:

- open a context menu that has disabled menuitems. i.e. right click on a video player on youtube
- use arrow keys to advance/rewind ""focus""


actual results:

- disabled menuitems can still gain `_moz-menuactive` attribute, even though there is no visual feedback to show that they are focused or hovered
- that is, the css rules that style the active menuitems explicitly say `:not([disabled=""true""])`, or they have some overriding rule like `[_moz-menuactive=""true""][disabled=""true""] {color: graytext;  background-color: unset;}`, so you can't tell whether a disabled button is ""active"" (in this case meaning keyboard-focused or cursor-hovered)
- from a sighted user's point of view, it looks like you're advancing down the list, then all of a sudden the cursor showing the selected menu/menuitem just abruptly disappears, before reappearing when you navigate to the next non-disabled element in the list.


expected results:

- those rules are clearly intended to prevent visual feedback that would mislead a sighted user into thinking the element is an active affordance.
- but the functions that advance through menuitems do not abide by the same philosophy. this could mislead a blind or visually impaired user depending on their screen reader settings, but presumably it's also visually confusing and annoying for sighted users, (at least for me) since an element that can't be activated or interacted with in any way is being pseudo-focused, so it's consuming keyboard inputs. and meanwhile, there's no visual indication that it's holding focus except for the absence of highlighting on any other menuitems in the list.
- there's a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14841) from 2 decades ago making the opposite argument. i know there are differing opinions on this, since the existence of the disabled button should still be apparent to screen readers. but there are ways to make disabled buttons visible to screen readers and still let the keyboard navigation walker skip them. look at the customizable toolbar buttons for example.
- looking at the most modern parts of firefox, i can't find any examples of focus behaving like the context menus do. but i can find a ton of counterexamples, like [browser-toolbarkeynav.js](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser-toolbarkeynav.js#65), [panelmultiview.jsm](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/customizableui/panelmultiview.jsm#1594), even [the basic button element](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/content/widgets/button.js#189).
- also, making disabled buttons known to screen readers is not the be-all, end-all, since the buttons do not provide any information as to why they are disabled. even with vision, the most a user can glean from their existence is the fact that they could conceivably provide the named functionality in some other, unknown circumstance.
- i still think that's valuable information so i wouldn't want them hidden, either visually or to screen readers, but i think the priority of visibility should be lower than that of avoiding the confusion caused by permitting disabled elements to be focused, especially when there's no visual feedback. ideally, they should be read by screen readers but not focusable at all, just like toolbar buttons with open popups. to that end, context menus could use the same kind of node filter setup that the javascript key navigation modules use.","I would rate this bug report as ""good"".

""I was testing Firefox with my keyboard and noticed some weird behavior when navigating through disabled menu items in a context menu. For instance, if I right-click on a YouTube video player and then use the arrow keys to advance or rewind, I can still select disabled menu items even though there's no visual feedback indicating that they're focused or hovered. This is problematic because those menu items have CSS rules that style them differently when they're active, but since they're disabled, it looks like nothing's happening - and that's confusing.

""As someone who's familiar with screen readers, I can imagine how this could be even more frustrating for visually impaired users. The problem is that the functions that advance through menu items don't respect the same philosophy as the CSS rules intended to prevent visual feedback from misleading sighted users.

add an utility function named appendfrominterleavedbuffer in

function does the same job as what audioinputprocessing::insertingraph
and nativeinputtrack::processinput were used to do. as a result, these
two functions can be eliminated or simplified.

I'm experiencing an issue with my Bluetooth microphone in Firefox 91.0. Specifically, it stopped working properly during web meetings or calls using software like 3cx and Webex. I've tried granting temporary or permanent access to the mic, but it doesn't make a difference - it just doesn't work.

The weird thing is that this issue only started happening after I upgraded from Firefox 90.0.2 to 91.0. I've tried downgrading back to 90.0.2 and the microphone works fine again. So, it seems like something in the 91.0 update broke my Bluetooth mic.

Here are the steps to reproduce the issue:

* Start with a clean install of Firefox 90.0.2 (no extensions installed, new profile)
* Connect my Sony WH-XB900N headset
* Go to a web-meeting site and grant access to the microphone
* Make a call - speaker works fine, but the mic is not picking up any audio

Then, I updated to Firefox 91.0:

* Rebooted my computer
* Connected my headset again
* Went to a web-meeting site and granted access to the microphone
* Made a call again - speaker still works, but the mic is now muted!

After downgrading back to 90.0.2, everything worked fine again.

The MozRegression log shows some details about the changeset that caused this issue:

* The commit message mentions adding an utility function in audiosegment to append interleaved buffer data
* It seems like something changed around this point that broke my Bluetooth mic

Expected result: my Bluetooth microphone should still work properly after upgrading from Firefox 90.0.2 to 91.0."

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:78.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/78.0

steps to reproduce:

there is a bug with downloading canon’s cr3 files (raw image format).
if you download a cr3 file, firefox automatically change the file extension to .mp4 – instead of cr3.

you can reproduce it like this:

- download a cr3 file (for example here below: https://www.dkamera.de/testbericht/canon-eos-m6-mark-ii/beispielaufnahmen.html or here: https://www.dpreview.com/sample-galleries/3577431182/canon-rf-28-70mm-f2-l-sample-gallery-dpreview-tv/9300505795 – it is important, that you download the raw photo)

- save it

- you will find the file in your location with .mp4 instead of cr3

please also see the attached screenshot.

with canon's old file format .cr2, firefox does not have problems (you can test it here: https://www.dkamera.de/testbericht/canon-eos-70d/beispielaufnahmen.html or here: https://www.dpreview.com/sample-galleries/9485291827/canon-eos-5d-mark-iv-sample-gallery/7296166408 )

But when I do this in Firefox, it automatically changes the file extension to .MP4 instead of leaving it as .CR3. This is really annoying because I need the files to be in their original format. To reproduce this issue, you can try downloading one of these CR3 files from a website like DKamera or DPreview (just make sure you're actually downloading the raw photo). Once you've downloaded the file and saved it, you'll see that the extension has been changed to .MP4 instead of .CR3. I've attached a screenshot as proof. Interestingly, Firefox doesn't have this problem with Canon's older CR2 file format, so maybe it's just something new with CR3 files?

1. go to https://jsfiddle.net/3js69ngu/3/. you will find a custom web component imitating a checkbox form control.
2. click on ""submit form"" in the ""custom checkbox"" section



actual results:

- no validation message appears
- console error: ""an invalid form control is not focusable.""

there is the ""setvalidity(flags?: validitystateflags, message?: string, anchor?: htmlelement): void;"" method to set the validity state of a custom component using elementinternals. as per description, the ""anchor"" parameter, which is used as the anchor to display the validity message, is optional. however, in firefox, the message is not displayed as long anchor parameter is not provided. the error message ""an invalid form control is not focusable."" is not true, as the custom form component (see https://jsfiddle.net/3js69ngu/3/) is focusable. providing the host of the component as parameter is not possible, as the anchor parameter element needs to be inside the shadow dom.

definition:
anchor – an htmlelement which can be used by the user agent to report problems with this form submission.

What happens is that no validation message shows up, and in the console, I get an error saying ""an invalid form control is not focusable."" But here's the thing - the custom component is definitely focusable! The problem seems to be that Firefox isn't displaying the validation message unless I provide an anchor element, which doesn't make sense. According to the documentation, the anchor parameter should only be required if you want to display the error message somewhere specific. In this case, since the custom form component has its own host and is focusable, it seems like Firefox should just display the message there instead of complaining about not being focusable.

""I've got a weird issue with Firefox on Windows 10 (haven't checked other platforms yet). So, I launched Firefox and made sure both the browser and my OS were set to dark theme - you know, for that sleek, modern look. Then, I went to any old webpage, clicked the star icon to bookmark it, and opened up the location dropdown menu to scroll down a bit if needed. What I expected to happen was that all the elements would follow suit with the theme colors and look nice and dark. But nope - the separator line is still this weird dark color that doesn't respect the theme layout at all. I've attached a screenshot (screenshot_2.png) to show what I mean, in case it's not clear from my rambling description. Oh, and by the way, I've passed this on to our QA team for further investigation - maybe they can dig up more info or find a fix."""

Hey, I'm reporting an issue that just happened while using Firefox beta 132.0b8 and 132.0b9 on Windows 11, macOS Sequoia 15.0.1, and Ubuntu 22.04.

Then, I opened a new tab, clicked ""Finish setup"", and... whoops! The ""Set up"" checklist wasn't showing the options it should have had.

So, I've been noticing this weird issue with Firefox Nightly on my Linux laptop running Wayland (I tried it on X11 too, but it doesn't happen there). To reproduce it, you need to do a few things: first, make sure you're running Firefox Nightly and have the `moz_enable_wayland=1` flag enabled in your Wayland session. Then, head into `about:config` and set `apz.overscroll.enabled` to `true`. Next, load up any webpage that's got a lot of vertical scrolling goodness going on. Now, use your touchpad to overscroll the page all the way up (you know, like when you accidentally scroll past the top and it won't stop). The important part is that once you're fully overscrolled, lift your fingers off the touchpad without actually moving or triggering any momentum scrolling. What should happen next is that Firefox kicks in with a snap-back animation to get things back on track. But what actually happens is... nothing. The page just stays stuck in the overscrolled state until you manually scroll back down to relieve it."

So, I've been noticing this weird issue in Firefox - when I download an MP3 file and it autoplays in a new tab, clicking the ""go back"" button doesn't stop the playback like I'd expect. Instead, the song just keeps playing in the background, and the only way to get rid of it is to close the whole tab. This happens in Firefox 92.0b8 and 93.0a1 on my Windows 11 machine.

To reproduce this issue, I launch Firefox, head to a specific page that has MP3 files available for download (like [this one](https://file-examples.com/index.php/sample-audio-files/sample-mp3-download/)), click ""download"" for any of the MP3 files, and then the file autoplays in a new tab. From there, I just click ""go back"" to get back to the original page. What should happen is that the playback stops, but instead it keeps going on and on.

I've also noticed some additional quirks - sometimes when I navigate away from the MP3 file or come back to it later, the playback will stop where it left off, rather than resetting to the start of the song. And weirdly, sometimes when I launch Firefox with the same profile and go straight to that page, the MP3 will automatically start playing without me even asking for it! I couldn't reproduce this initial issue on normal builds, but I did notice the playback continuing where it left off in some cases.

""I'm reporting a weird issue I found while watching videos on CBS News. When you load up one of their vids and activate the subtitles, the padding around them gets way too tall! This happens when using Nightly v102.0a1, Beta v101.0b2, Release, or ESR versions of the browser on Windows 10, 7, Mac OS 11, or Ubuntu. To reproduce this bug, just follow these steps: launch your browser, go to https://www.cbsnews.com/video/music-therapy-helps-addicts-recover-through-song/#x, play the video and turn on subs, then click the pip button. What I expect to see is a reasonable amount of padding around the subtitles - but what actually happens is way too much! This issue has been there since the implementation, so it's not a new regression or anything. One weird thing is that this doesn't happen when watching other news sites with similar subs (like CBC News), and it was kinda intermittent on some systems I tested on, which makes me think it might be tied to some hardware or driver setup."""

**regression range**
* initially, the focus consisted of the dotted-line surrounding the list area, that wasn't ""stealing"" focus from the listed elements (even as it was colored blue .... so considering that as ""good"":
* first bad: 2019-09-25;
* last good: 2019-09-24;

All 4 items are present in this bug report!",16,16,100.0,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,True,1,True,1,True,2,True,1,True,1,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,1,"Here's the rewritten bug report:

So I noticed a weird issue with Firefox's about:downloads page on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20. When you launch Firefox, download some test files, and then go to about:downloads, everything looks normal at first. But when you press the tab key or click on any of the listed downloads, the highlighted effect gets applied to the elements as expected. However, there's a weird regression that happened around September 2019 - instead of just highlighting the list items like it used to, the focus now jumps to this dotted-line surrounding the list area (it looks blue, kinda like an outline). That's not what I want! It ""steals"" the focus from the actual download items. I'm attaching a screenshot that shows what I mean, and honestly, this is something that could be improved to make it more consistent with other browser areas, like about:addons - the theme section does it way better."
