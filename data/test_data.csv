* select ""list view"" option
* click ok
* enter some random text in the ""description field""
* click ""new item"" in the left hand bar

observe a alert saying ""this page is asking you to confirm that you want to leave - data you have entered may not be saved.""

close firefox.

start firefox as if geckodriver had started it e.g.
* `firefox.exe ""--marionette"" ""-foreground"" ""-no-remote"" ""-profile"" ""c:\\users\\jnord\\appdata\\local\\temp\\rust_mozprofilen6vbxm""`

""So I'm testing Firefox with the `--marionette` argument, and what I've noticed is that alerts just don't seem to work when you start it up this way. Specifically, I've tried reproducing this issue on both Windows (Firefox 85 and 87 nightlies) and Linux (just Firefox 85), and consistently, no alert pops up. Now, I know this might sound weird, but stick with me - what's happening is that if you start a Jenkins server first, and then launch Firefox normally, you'll see the expected behavior: when you try to leave a page without saving your changes, an alert will pop up asking you to confirm whether you really want to bail. But here's the thing: if you restart Firefox with the `--marionette` flag (like this: `firefox.exe ""--marionette"" ""-foreground"" ""-no-remote"" ""-profile"" ""c:\\users\\jnord\\appdata\\local\\temp\\rust_mozprofilen6vbxm""`), and then try to reproduce that same behavior - navigating to Jenkins, clicking around, entering some dummy text... nothing. No alert shows up. I was trying to debug this issue by running a test script (https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/src/test/java/core/formvalidationtest.java), and what it kept timing out on was the `waitFor(alert)` part - which makes sense, given that no alert is actually being shown. So yeah, I'm basically reporting that Firefox doesn't show alerts when you start it up with `--marionette`."""

So, I've been noticing this weird issue with Firefox and my Magic Mouse on a Mac (running 10.15). When I have the swipe gesture enabled for between pages and over-scrolling is turned on, things get wonky. Here's what happens: if I perform multiple swipe down gestures to scroll through a webpage, then try to quickly swipe right or left with one finger (or two fingers on my trackpad) to switch between tabs while the animation is still running, the rubberbanding effect just gets stuck and refuses to reset until I start scrolling again. This happens with both my Magic Mouse and trackpad, so it's not a hardware-specific issue. I've attached some recordings to demonstrate the problem if you want to take a look (link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1omhx3kzl1dtaaj4ij0usjxbianlvepwk/view?usp=sharing). Interestingly, this doesn't happen when using Safari, so it's specific to Firefox."

steps to reproduce:

firefox 89 is opened with two tabs.
1 - i click on the 'save to pocket' icon when i'm on the first tab.
2 - then i switch to the second tab.
3 - finally i switch back to the first tab.


actual results:

1 - the pocket icon turns red, indicating that the tab is saved.
2 - the pocket icon turns red too, incorrectly indicating that the tab is saved
3 - the pocket icon has been reset to black, incorrectly indicating that the tab is not saved


expected results:

1 - ok, this is the correct behavior
2 - pocket icon should stay dark when i move to another tab that has not been saved.
3 - when going back to a saved tab, the pocket icon should reflect the saved status (this last one is more an enhancement, as i think we had this behavior before firefox 89)
basically the pocket icon should always reflect the status of the tab (saved or not in pocket)",good,14,16,87.5,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,False,0,False,0,True,2,True,1,True,1,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,1,"Here's the rewritten bug report:

""I was messing around with Firefox 89 and noticed some weirdness with the 'Save to Pocket' feature. So, I opened two tabs and started testing. First, I clicked the 'Save to Pocket' icon on the first tab - no big deal, it turned red as expected. Then, I switched to the second tab and did nothing. Finally, I went back to the first tab... and that's when things got wonky. The pocket icon not only stayed red (like it should), but also changed color on the second tab! I mean, I hadn't even tried to save that one yet. To top it off, when I went back to the original saved tab, the icon was suddenly black again, like nothing had ever been saved in the first place. It looks like the pocket icon is getting out of sync with the actual state of the tabs - especially when switching between them. My expectation would be that the icon stays dark on an unsaved tab and reflects the saved status (or not) on a saved one. Maybe this behavior changed with Firefox 89, but I think it's worth looking into."""

I've been testing Firefox Nightly 89.0a1 on my Macs (running macOS 10.14 and 10.15) and I've stumbled upon an issue that I thought I'd share with you. When I have the ""apz.overscroll.enabled"" preference turned on, I notice that if I open any webpage and scroll up and down to trigger the overscroll effect, then interact with the blank space at the end of the page (even though it's just empty), something weird happens. What I expected was that the cursor would remain static and not budge, but what actually happens is that the cursor's position changes (although you can't see it visually) depending on how long I've scrolled - it moves up or down accordingly. To illustrate this, check out the video attachment I uploaded (9214642). In it, I'm scrolling and pressing mouse button 2 in the overscroll area to open context menus, but even though the cursor is stuck in place, the overscroll effect is still dragging it upwards. This isn't a new problem since the feature was added - I've been seeing this behavior with Nightly 89."

Instead of creating a normal bookmark shortcut, it creates an empty folder with the title I just set! And get this - Windows pops up an error message saying that the file name is incorrect.

I've tried messing around with the title length and it seems like if the title is shorter than 20 characters or so, Firefox will still create the bookmark shortcut fine. But when it's longer than that, I get this weird folder creation instead. Has anyone else seen something like this happen?"""

steps to reproduce:

- i noticed this on windows 10, nightly 90.0a1, build 20210525093431, with proton settings enabled. i went ahead and made a brand new, empty profile with the profile manager to test it. the bug is always present, seems to just be an oversight

str:
- click & hold on the new tab button
- opens a context menu, `.new-tab-popup`
- click ""no container"", it opens a new tab with context id 0
- now right click the new tab button
- opens a similar context menu, `#new-tab-button-popup`
- click ""no container""


actual results:

- it does nothing
- looking at the dom, the menus look identical. in both cases the menuitems for the actual containers have `command` attributes that invoke [opennewusercontexttab](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#4857), which gets the context id from an attribute on the click event target, the menuitem.
- but in both popups, the ""no container"" menuitem has no command attribute, nor does it have any other event listeners.


expected results:

so why the different behavior — i think this is because the click & hold popup is a child of the new tab button, whereas the right-click popup is off on its own in `#mainpopupset`.

so when you click the ""no container"" item in the click & hold popup, the event is bubbling up to the new tab button, which has event listeners like `command=""cmd_newnavigatortab""` and `oncommand=""browseropentab(event);""`.

when you click the same item in the right-click popup, nothing opens because there isn't any command event listener targeting it or its parent.

you can see that adding `command=""cmd_newnavigatortab""` or `command=""browser:newusercontexttab""` to the ""no container"" item in the right-click menu fixes the issue. the command attribute can also just be added to the right-click menupopup itself.

so i'm pretty sure the issue is purely that there aren't any event listeners for the ""no container"" items, and i guess this was just overlooked because it's accidentally working correctly in the click & hold menu, due to the event bubbling up to an element that just so happens to have an almost identical purpose/behavior.

so i think my suggestion is to add the command attribute to the menuitem [when it's being created](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/utilityoverlay.js#780).","Here's my assessment:

ff detects it's not windows default theme, and (probably) interprets it as a high-contrast one (which is not).

persist search tip not displayed.mp4

**[notes]:**
- i think that this happens because even if the profile is enrolled in the experiment and has the feature enabled, the ""browser.urlbar.showsearchterms.featuregate"" pref remains set to ""false"" (which is expected for an experiment). 
- even if you restart the browser multiple times, the persist search tip is not triggered.
- however, if we are enrolled in the experiment, and manually change the ""browser.urlbar.showsearchterms.featuregate"" pref to true, the persist search tip is displayed after a restart. 
- this issue is not reproducible on nightly builds or early beta builds, due to the fact that the feature is already enabled by default.

**[affected versions]:**
- firefox beta 110.0b9.

**[affected platforms]:**
- mac 12.4
- windows 10 x64
- linux mint 20

**[prerequisites]:**
- have firefox beta 110.0b9 en-us build extracted/installed.
- have the ""nimbus.debug"" set to true.

2. navigate to the [following url](about:studies?optin_slug=persist-search-term-staged-rollout-phase-1&optin_branch=treatment-a&optin_collection=nimbus-preview), in order to force enroll in the experiment.
3. restart the browser.

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:106.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/106.0

steps to reproduce:

* observed the firefox view icon at the left end of the tab bar.
* selected it, and observed a button to start using it.
* received dialog to enter primary password (i had cancelled the entry when i started nightly.)
* tried to enter password several times, very carefully, but unsuccessfully. this may be a problem as i almost always get the password correct when i am careful.
* tried to cancel the password dialog, hoping to cancel setting up the tab pickup feature. this did not work.
* finally my primary password was accepted after several more attempts during which i was watching which keys i pressed.

actual results:

""I'm using Firefox 106.0 on my Windows 10 machine (Mars), and I ran into some issues with the tab pickup feature. The problem started when I noticed the view icon at the left end of the tab bar, which is usually a good thing! But things got weird when I tried to set up tab pickup - I got a dialog asking for my primary password, which I cancelled initially (I was in the middle of setting up Nightly, so I didn't want to interrupt). When I went back to try and enter the password again, it wouldn't accept it no matter how carefully I typed it. This is weird because I'm usually super careful when entering passwords and I don't have issues. I tried canceling the dialog a few times, but nothing worked - the setup process kept going on despite my attempts to stop it. It wasn't until I entered the password multiple times (and watched which keys I pressed) that it finally accepted it. When I did enter the password correctly, I expected it would work smoothly like it usually does in other situations, but instead, cancelling the dialog still didn't cancel setting up tab pickup. That's what happened - entering my password was super finicky and the cancel button wasn't doing its job."""

### steps to reproduce
1. go to settings - privacy and security - enhanced tracking protection and switch off the toggle.
2. load a page, and tap on the lock icon from the toolbar.
3. observe the panel.

### expected behavior
the panel displayes the name of the page, the connection status, the tracking protection off status, and the ""clear cookies and site data"" option.

### actual behavior
the panel displays a double line between the connection status, and the ""clear cookies and site data"" option. the etp off status is not displayed at all.

### device information
* firefox version: nightly 119.0a1 from 8/29, beta 118.0b1, rc 117.0
* android devices: all

### any additional information?
* reproducible with the toolbar set up/down,
* reproducible also on nightly 111.0a1,
* not reproducible when a single page has the etp turned off","I'd rate this bug report as ""good"". Here's why:

When you do that, a panel pops up with some info, like the page name, connection status, whether tracking protection is off or not, and an option to clear cookies and site data. That's what I expected to see, but instead, there's this weird double line between the connection status and the ""Clear Cookies"" button - it's pretty annoying!

synced tabs.png

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:78.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/78.0

steps to reproduce:

- install firefox, sign in, and enable syncing on an ios device (ipad and iphone tested), an desktop device (multiple windows 10 and macos big sur tested), and any other device (mobile or desktop).
- go into the firefox settings on the ios and desktop devices and change the device name
- verify that the device names have changed on the account (https://accounts.firefox.com, press ""sync now"" to push the change on any devices if necessary)
- open the ""synced tabs"" window on the third device


actual results:

in any ""synced tabs"" menu (including the sidebar and list under any ""library"" option) the name of the x86 device has changed but the ios device still shows the original name.


expected results:

the name of the ios device should have changed to whatever it was set to, just like it does for other devices.

note: though this issue only seems to affect ios devices, i do not believe it is actually an issue with firefox for ios but rather with the ""synced tabs"" menu/bars everywhere as the issue is visible in these menus on ios as well as the desktop, which is why i am submitting it as a firefox bug and not a firefox for ios bug

note 2: the attached file is a screenshot of my ""synced tabs"" bard showing the list of the devices syncing to my account (with a few personal names blacked out). as you can see, both the ios devices are named ""firefox on ____'s (device)"" even though the names for both devices have been changed to just ""iphone"" and ""ipad"" (ie i removed the ""firefox on ____'s""), and those changes are properly reflected in the account settings.","Here's my assessment:

""I'm reporting an issue with syncing Firefox tabs across multiple devices, including my iOS iPad and iPhone, as well as my Windows 10 desktop. When I changed the device names on both my iOS and desktop devices, the changes didn't propagate correctly to the 'Synced Tabs' menu - specifically, my iOS devices still show their original names, while my x86 device shows the updated name. This is weird because the changes do appear in my account settings (accounts.firefox.com) when I press 'Sync Now'. What's trippy is that this issue only seems to affect iOS devices, but since it also appears in the 'Synced Tabs' menu on my desktop, I think it's a Firefox bug rather than an issue with Firefox for iOS.

""So, I noticed this weird thing happening when I installed an add-on and then uninstalled it later.

The thing is, when you uninstall the add-on later, this pref doesn't get cleared out of about:config - it just sticks around.

To reproduce this bug, you can follow these steps: install a non-recommended add-on, access its detail page and allow it to access restricted sites, check that the pref has been created in about:config, uninstall the add-on, and then come back to about:config to see that the pref is still there.

I was trying to help translate an article on Mozilla's support site into Brazilian Portuguese (pt-br) when I hit a snag. I went to the page https://support.mozilla.org/pt-br/kb/limpe-historico-e-dados-pessoais-firefox-android and noticed that the <h1> title had a typo - it said ""nav(a)gação"" instead of the correct translation, which should be ""nav(e)gação"". I tried using the Pontoon add-on to find the original translation, but no luck. I selected the word with the typo and used two different options: searching in Sumo and searching in all projects. Neither worked - I got a big fat ""no results"" on the Pontoon page. Even when I manually searched for the word, it was nowhere to be found. That means I couldn't fix the typo, which is frustrating because I know there are probably other people who would want to help with the translation too."

### steps to reproduce
1. make sure to enable the translations feature on fenix nightly/beta.
2. go to three-dot menu - settings - translations - download languages.
3. tap on the ""all languages"" and wait for the download to finish, while observing.

### expected behavior
after tapping the download icon, the ""all languages"" option is not displayed anymore 
all the download icons near the languages are replaced by the loading icon.
as soon as the languages are downloaded, the loading icon is replaced by the delete icon.
the ""delete all languages"" option is displayed as soon as at least one of the languages is downloaded.

### actual behavior
some of the languages remain in the loading state for a while. 
after a while, the loading icons are being replaced by the download icons.

### device information
* firefox version: nightly 128.0a1
* android device: google pixel 6 (android 14)

So, I noticed a weird issue with the translations feature on Fenix Nightly/Beta - specifically when downloading all languages. Here's what happens: first, you gotta enable the translations feature in settings, then go to three-dot menu > settings > translations > download languages. When you tap ""All Languages"" and wait for it to finish downloading, a few things happen that don't quite make sense. Initially, all the download icons next to each language disappear and are replaced with loading icons. But once some of the languages are actually downloaded, the loading icons turn into delete icons, and you get the option to ""Delete All Languages"". That's not what I'm complaining about - it's what happens after that. Sometimes, some of the languages just stay stuck in the loading state for a bit before finally showing the download icon again. And then, out of nowhere, the delete icon shows up, even if you haven't actually deleted any languages yet! It seems like this issue is linked to downloading all languages, deleting them, and then redownloading them - not super reproducible, but it happens often enough that I thought I'd report it."

in firefox:

about:preferences.

search for ""color.""

and set override to ""always.""

click ""edit bug"" here.

click on the ""platform"" menu and try to select a platform.


actual results:

the menu strobes.


expected results:

it shouldn't strobe, and should let users select a platform.

the strobing goes away if i set override to ""never.""

this does not go away if i use mozregression and test on an older version which uses user colors instead of high-contrast mode.

this does go away in troubleshoot mode, but, well troubleshoot mode cuts a lot of other strobe-blocking fixes.

this doesn't go away if i comment out my font size css, so that's not it.

this doesn't go away if i disable all extensions, and for safety reasons, i usually need to enable most of them.

The problem persists even if I test an older version of Firefox using Mozregression, which makes me think it's specific to the new user colors. Interestingly, the strobing goes away when I'm in Troubleshoot mode, but that's not a practical solution since it disables other important fixes.

""I ran into an issue with Firefox on multiple platforms (Windows 10x64, macOS 11, macOS 10.15.7, and Ubuntu 20) - specifically in version 89.0a1 (build date April 12, 2021). When I set the browser.proton.enabled preference to true and launched FF, went to about:newtab, and inspected the cogwheel icon in the top-right corner of the page, I expected it to match the mock-up design. But what happened was way off - the icon that's supposed to take me to about:preferences didn't look right at all! This isn't a new issue, though; it's specifically related to Proton and doesn't seem to be a regression from any previous version. Oh, and just to confirm, this problem shows up no matter what theme I'm using - light, dark, or Alpenglow, on both macOS and Ubuntu (with either the OS set to light or dark). That's the story!"""

**user agent**: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:132.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/132.0

**steps to reproduce:**
check out the source of the attached file demo. or follow these instructions:
create a group of dom elements inside a stage that is longer than its container. the overflow is hidden.
each element is positioned next to another, at a small distance.
add pointer event listeners with attached handlers that read the user's dragging actions over the stage surface.
apply the pointer dragging delta value on the x translation value of each element from the group, using a for-loop that adjusts each x coordinate by this delta.

**expected result:**
all the dom elements from this stage should move in lockstep on a dragging action, without any delays, since all of them have exactly the same kind of translations and transition applied at once, collectively.

**actual result:**
dom elements that are outside the viewport of the stage container and which come into view from the hidden overflow area show a graphical delay while rendering the translation on which the same transition string is applied.
you can see this by running the demo i attached in the latest firefox (132) and comparing that to the latest chrome (131). or you could try load the video from the link below -- the firefox test is on the top side, the chrome test is on the bottom side.

**video demo:**

(file will be taken down after this case gets resolved)

don't know how to use the regression tool and don't have time to invest in this, but i did something to help you out. i downloaded past versions of firefox and tested to see which was the last version in which rendering was normal for this case. that was **123.0**. the rendering problem can be seen already in version **124.0**, so that will narrow it down for you to just a few intermediary versions.

i imagine it's a similar cause as the last time i reported a rendering bug. you're doing some optimisation somewhere: elements are queued for graphical updates but those in the hidden overflow area get their update on the next tick, to improve performance. but this makes elements in scenarios like this one behave in a way that breaks the logic of ""same rules applied to similar elements should behave in the same way"". i think browser optimisations should not break how elements should behave according to web standards.

i hope this can get resolved in less than a month. thanks.","**good**

I've attached a file called rendertest.html that shows an issue with Firefox (specifically version 132.0) - it's really annoying and I'm hoping someone can help me fix it! 

So, here's what's going on: when you have a bunch of elements inside a container stage, where the overflow is hidden, and each element is positioned next to another at a small distance, if you add pointer event listeners that apply dragging actions over the stage surface, all the elements should move in sync. And they do - except for those outside the viewport that come into view from the hidden overflow area. 

In Firefox 132.0, there's this weird graphical delay when these elements come into view, like the rendering of their translation is being delayed or something. It's really noticeable if you compare it to the same test in Chrome (version 131). I've even made a video demo that shows this issue - it's at http://163.172.222.229/temp/v.mp4 (note: the file will be taken down once this case is resolved).

I did some digging and found out that this issue started happening around Firefox version 124.0, but in version 123.0 everything was working fine. So, I'm guessing it's something to do with an optimization or two somewhere that's causing these issues.

In my experience, when browsers optimize performance, they should still stick to the rules of how elements should behave according to web standards. In this case, it seems like the optimisation is breaking the logic of how similar elements should behave in a consistent way. I'm hoping someone can help me resolve this issue within a month - thanks!"

I'm experiencing an issue where on the ""about:welcome"" page, there's a weird blank area that shows up at the top right corner and makes it impossible to see the sign-in button. This happens when I have either the light or dark theme enabled - no difference there! However, if I switch to the white theme, the sign-in button disappears completely. It's pretty annoying.

I've tried it on different platforms (Mac 10.15.7, Windows 10 x64, and Ubuntu 20.04 x64) with both the latest Firefox Nightly (102.0a1) and Beta (101.0b2) builds installed. I also created a new profile for each build to rule out any personalization or setting issues.

To reproduce this bug, follow these steps: open up the browser with that brand-new profile, resize it to about 25%, and take a look at the top right corner of the ""about:welcome"" page. You should see the blank area popping up instead of the sign-in button being visible - which is what I'm expecting.

The issue seems to have started in one of the recent builds (I used Mozregression tools to pinpoint it), specifically between revisions b6fd2cff0114d93e9e2b69482b448441954e31d6 and 41bd981c36227b155896e7f0014ca634c2a90dab.

Hey, I wanted to file a bug report because I noticed something weird going on in Firefox.

* Launch Firefox
* Set the ""browser.theme.temporary.monochromatic.enabled"" option to true
* Select any of the monochromatic themes

What I expect to see is that the theme color just changes directly without any extra line. But what actually happens is that this residual line shows up, separating the tab bar from the toolbar.

This issue doesn't seem to be a regression (i.e., it's not something new that was introduced recently), and it happens on both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04.

When I use an RTL build locale like Arabic or Hebrew, I noticed some weirdness with add-on suggestions in the URL bar. Specifically, when I type a keyword to trigger the suggestions, the last character of the first two lines doesn't show up where it should - it's like it gets cut off and appears at the beginning instead. Additionally, the orientation of the review stars is wonky too; for example, if an add-on has half a star as its rating, the empty half shows up on the right side instead of the left.

**[notes]:**
- this issue might affect the ""pin private window"" modal from the mr onboarding flow for the existing users as the modal is displayed even if the ""private window"" shortcut is already pinned to the taskbar.

**[affected versions]:**
- firefox nightly 105.0a1 - build id: 20220612185901

**[affected platforms]:**
- windows 10 x64

**[prerequisites]:**
- have the following prefs in the ""about:config"" page:
  - ""nimbus.debug"" pref set to ""true"".
  - ""browser.promo.pin.enabled"" set to ""true""
- have the ""remote settings devtools"" add-on installed from [here](https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/remote-settings-devtools/releases).

**[steps to reproduce]:**
1. open the browser with the profile from the prerequisites.
2. click the ""remote settings devtools"" tollbar button from the right part of the toolbar.
3. switch the environment to ""stage"" and restart the browser.
4. navigate to the ""about:studies?optin_slug=cmuresandesktop-nimbus-exploration-080522&optin_branch=treatment-a&optin_collection=nimbus-preview"" url.
5. open a ""private window"" and click the ""pin to taskbar"" button.
6. restart the browser and navigate to the ""about:telemetry"" page.
7. search for the ""os.environment.is_taskbar_pinned_private"" scalar and observe the value.

**[expected result]:**
- the value of the ""os.environment.is_taskbar_pinned_private"" scalar is set to ""true"".

**[actual result]:**
- the value of the ""os.environment.is_taskbar_pinned_private"" scalar is set to ""false"".

**[regression window]:**
- considering that this issue is not reproducible on firefox beta 104 using the mozregression tool i have managed to find the following regression window:
last good revision: 113593df627273c8e66f58bf735c38ad7e937f38

Hey Ben, I've got a weird issue that popped up and I think you should take a look at it. So, I was testing some things out with Firefox Nightly 105.0a1 (build id: 20220612185901) on Windows 10 x64, and I had some specific settings enabled - namely, the ""nimbus.debug"" pref set to true and the ""browser.promo.pin.enabled"" pref also set to true. I'd installed the ""remote settings devtools"" add-on too.

To reproduce the issue, here's what I did: first, I opened the browser with those prefs in place, then clicked on the remote settings devtools toolbar button, switched to the stage environment and restarted the browser. Next, I navigated to this URL - about:studies?optin_slug=cmuresandesktop-nimbus-exploration-080522&optin_branch=treatment-a&optin_collection=nimbus-preview - opened a private window, clicked ""pin to taskbar"", and then restarted the browser again. Finally, I went to the telemetry page (about:telemetry), searched for this scalar (""os.environment.is_taskbar_pinned_private""), and saw that it was set to false.

The thing is, I was expecting it to be true - like, it should have been recorded as pinned. But nope, it's stuck at false. And get this - if I do the same thing on Firefox Beta 104 using the mozregression tool, I don't see the issue. That made me think maybe it's something new in Nightly? Anyway, I used that regression tool and found out that the last good revision was 113593df627273c8e66f58bf735c38ad7e937f38, while the first bad revision was 23d27ffb8a811e38a46621aa06044ff3acaac2b9.

**tested platforms**
* affected platforms: windows 11 and ubuntu 22.04
* unaffected platforms: macos 13.6

**preconditions**
* activate the feature by setting `browser.tabs.cardpreview.enabled` as `true` in about:config
* have the `browser.tabs.cardpreview.delayms` as `1000` (default at this time) so that the issue can be seen better

**steps to reproduce**
1. open a few websites in different tabs
2. hover the mouse cursor over a few tabs that are not in focus or the one who is also in focus.

**expected result**
* the delay set is applied when hovering over the first tab the user chooses, after that there is no delay for the preview if hovering over the rest of the tabs. just as it works on mac.

**actual result**
* the delay is applied every single time the user hovers over a tab even when switching between tabs.

**regression range**
* not a regression since this is reproducible on old nightly build from 2024-01-13 where this feature officially landed.

steps to reproduce:

in mv2 extension;
- remove, if any, ""browser_popup"" from manifest.json
- set a popup in browser action click handler, using browser.browseraction.setpopup
- call browser.browseraction.openpopup

if you add the default_popup in manifest, then the drop-down marker is always displayed and the ""default"" popup will display. but then, the click handler on browseraction is never called (normal behaviour).

if you try to ""remove"" the default popup (for all tabs) using browser.browseraction.setpopup({popup:null}), it's actually not removed and the click handler will not be called.
removing the default popup for all tabs, one by one, has the same effect:
 browser.tabs.query({}).then((tabs) => {
        for (let tab of tabs)

Hey, so I'm running into an issue with the MV2 extension. Specifically, it seems like there's a problem with how the popup works when you don't have a default popup defined in the manifest file (manifest.json) and you're using the browser action button to open something.

Here's what I did to reproduce the bug: first, I removed any existing ""browser_popup"" setting from the manifest.json if it was there. Then, I set up the browser action click handler to use `browser.browseraction.setpopup` and called `browser.browseraction.openpopup`. If you add a default popup to the manifest, everything works as expected - the drop-down marker is always displayed, and when you click on the button, the default popup opens. But if you don't have a default popup defined, things get weird: even though the drop-down marker shows up beside the button, trying to open the popup using `browser.browseraction.openpopup` doesn't do anything.

What's really frustrating is that if you try to ""remove"" the default popup for all tabs by calling `browser.browseraction.setpopup({popup:null})`, it doesn't actually remove it - and even more confusingly, the click handler on the browser action button never gets called.

[originally submitted via email, but the autoresponder asked to resubmit via bugzilla]
while testing a cookie auto deletion addon, i came across what seem to be a cookie/storage permission bypass.

steps to reproduce:

0. as usual serve the attached files using a local webserver (like python3 -mhttp.server) and access them on a
   non localhost ip.

1. i have tested this with a fresh firefox nightly (116.0a1 (2023-06-16)(64bit).
2. in the fresh profile set cookie blocking to ""custom"" and select to block ""all cookies"".[1]
3. confirm that normal access to local storage is blocked by using the attached test-noiframe.html
3a: access to the storage apis gives a ""domexception: the operation is insecure."", the storage tab in developer tools show no saved data.
4. but using the attached test2.html give unblocked access to local storage.

expected result:
firefox blocks storage access the same as when using the non iframe version of the test. no data stored.

actual result:
the storage apis work and ignore the setting to block the access:
* no exception on usage
* when entering data in the textbox and pressing save, on reloading the page, the page can retrieve the data.
* the saved data is not visible in developer tools, but even after restarting firefox the page can still read back the data.
* the origin with the saved data is shown in ""manage cookies and site data"" as having used storage.

i have not tracked done the regression point, but using firefox 100, the blocking works and the api access gives the expected exceptions.
this seems to be a recent regression.

the core part of test2.html is as follows. it seems by just using the contentwindow of a otherwise defaulted iframe,
the blocking of the storage api is evaded.
```html
<iframe id=""preview"" name=""preview""></iframe>
<script>
let p = document.getelementbyid('preview');
let currentdata = p.contentwindow.localstorage.getitem('blah');
document.getelementbyid('odata').innertext = currentdata;

function settest() {
    p.contentwindow.localstorage.setitem('blah', document.getelementbyid('idata').value);
}
</script>
```
from looking at the profile directory the local storage seems to be attributed to the origin used to access test2.html.

storage.sqlite
insert into origin values(2,'','192.168.123.123','http://192.168.123.123:4567','l9',9,1686945337316151,1,0);

insert into ""database"" values('http://192.168.123.123:4567',9,1686944680773745,0,6144);


i've played around a bit if this also allows evading storage isolation, but i did not the storage to leak across.

I was testing a cookie auto deletion add-on and stumbled upon what looks like a cookie/storage permission bypass. Here's how to reproduce it: serve the test files I attached using a local webserver (like Python 3) and access them on a non-localhost IP. I tested this with a fresh Firefox Nightly build (116.0a1, June 16, 2023, 64-bit). In the fresh profile, set cookie blocking to ""custom"" and select to block all cookies. Confirm that normal access to local storage is blocked by using the test-noiframe.html file - you should get a ""domexception: the operation is insecure."" message when trying to access storage APIs. However, if you use the test2.html file, you'll get unblocked access to local storage. What's weird is that Firefox doesn't throw any exceptions or show any data stored in the Storage tab of Developer Tools... but you can still retrieve and store data in the page. Even after restarting Firefox, the page can still read back the saved data. The ""Manage Cookies and Site Data"" panel shows the origin with the saved data as having used storage. I haven't tracked down the regression point yet, but using Firefox 100, blocking works as expected and you get the usual exceptions when trying to access storage APIs. This seems like a recent regression that's been introduced in newer versions of Firefox."

**[notes]:**
- after the fix to bug 1699703, the amazon sponsored top site has a different behavior: when dismissed, a single history tile pointing to the homepage is displayed (if the default amazon tile is of the url type).
- on fx versions 89 and 88 the amazon sponsored top site has the same behavior as described in this bug.

""Hey guys, I'm reporting an issue with Firefox on Windows 10, macOS 11.1, and Linux Mint 20.

To reproduce this issue, follow these steps: open Firefox and make sure you have certain settings enabled (specifically, `browser.topsites.useremote setting`, `browser.partnerlink.useattributionurl`, `browser.topsites.experiment.ebay-2020-1`, and `browser.search.region` set to a region that shows sponsored top sites).

What should happen is that you should see a single history tile pointing to the homepage after dismissing the sponsored top site. But what actually happens is that it creates multiple history tiles for every URL in your browsing history created by clicking on the sponsored link.

complete the following steps on macos 14.3 with a usb security key (i used a yubikey 5 nano) to reproduce:

1. open firefox's web developer tools
2. go to https://webauthn.io/?reguserverification=discouraged&attestation=none&attachment=cross_platform&alges256=true&algrs256=true&discoverablecredential=discouraged&reghints=&authuserverification=preferred

4. click ""register"" to call `navigator.credentials.create()`
5. select ""security key"" from the macos system prompt
6. tap security key (and enter pin and re-tap if needed)
7. observe that `response.transports` is an empty array (e.g. `[]`)

3. whether your ca has stopped, or has not yet stopped, issuing certificates with the problem. a statement that you have will be considered a pledge to the community; a statement that you have not requires an explanation. 

a hotfix was immediately deployed and tested after the issue was detected. no similar issuances can be performed currently. 

4. a summary of the problematic certificates. for each problem: number of certs, and the date the first and last certs with that problem were issued.  

three (3) ev tls certificates, issued between 2021-05-18 and 2021-07-12. 

5. the complete certificate data for the problematic certificates. the recommended way to provide this is to ensure each certificate is logged to ct and then list the fingerprints or crt.sh ids, either in the report or as an attached spreadsheet, with one list per distinct problem.

6. explanation about how and why the mistakes were made or bugs introduced, and how they avoided detection until now. 

the bug was introduced when the 2-person approval was migrated from the ca software to the ra portal on 2021-04-13. the purpose of this change was to allow full processing of validations in the ra portal by validation specialists.  

a faulty if check in the ra api code allowed issuance of ev tls certificates with a single person approval. the bug did not affect ev code signing or other types of certificates except ev tls . this issue also did not affect other validations performed via our ra portal; it was limited to our api, which is currently being used only by specific resellers for the issuance of a limited number of certificates. 

the bug passed undetected to the production systems despite the fact that the change was reviewed both within the development department (code review) and by the compliance department (change review). the issue was also not detected during our quarterly certificate reviews due to the low number of affected certificates. 

7. list of steps your ca is taking to resolve the situation and ensure such issuance will not be repeated in the future, accompanied with a timeline of when your ca expects to accomplish these things. 

immediate actions are described in steps 2-4 of this report and include the emergency deployment of the code fix to prevent further problematic issuances, the involvement of our internal auditing department, the thorough review of the possibly affected certificates and the revocation of the affected certificates after confirming the issue. 

initial review focuses on: 

- why the bug was introduced in the first place and in particular why it affected only ev tls certificates but not ev code signing, which follow the same 2p approval principle;
- how the issue was not detected during the code or compliance review, before reaching production.

our investigation is ongoing and analysis is being conducted to reveal any underlying weaknesses and, according to the results, decide any additional measures and improvements in our systems and processes, so that such occurrences are not repeated in the future. 

a full incident report shall be filed here when our investigation is complete. in the meantime, we will post regular updates.",Good,14,16,87.5,False,0,True,1,False,0,True,1,True,1,True,1,True,2,False,0,False,0,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,2,"So, I wanted to fill you in on a pretty important issue that came up with some of the digital certificates we issue. It turns out that back on July 10th, one of our validation specialists reviewed and approved an EV TLS order, but what happened was that when someone triggered an API call from our reseller side, the certificate got issued without proper two-person approval evidence stored in our system. This was brought to my attention by our customer care team, and we immediately sprang into action.

Here's a quick rundown of what went down:

* We reviewed the order and found that it had been approved by one of our specialists on July 10th.
* On July 12th, someone requested an update, and then an API call triggered the issuance of another certificate with serial number 776752935acf6697078d9cb5547921a6.
* A senior validation specialist discovered that this certificate was issued without proper approval evidence, so we reported it internally and started looking into what went wrong.

We quickly deployed a hotfix to prevent further issuances and then started digging deeper to figure out how many certificates were affected. It turned out that 11 EV TLS certificates had been issued without proper approval, and after some more investigation, we found two additional problematic ones. We revoked all three of them on July 19th.

We've got a team looking into what went wrong and why it wasn't caught during our usual code reviews or quarterly certificate reviews. As part of this, we're reviewing the migration of our 2-person approval process from our CA software to our RA portal back in April. It looks like a faulty IF check in the API code allowed for single-person approval, which is not supposed to happen.

We're working on resolving the situation and making sure it doesn't happen again. We've already taken some steps, including deploying that hotfix and revoking those problematic certificates. Our internal auditing department is involved too, and we're doing a thorough review of affected certificates. We'll post regular updates as our investigation continues, and once we have all the details figured out, we'll file a full incident report here."

starting with firefox 93, every time i updated firefox via the firefox setup installer to the newer version (93 -> 94 -> 95 -> 95.0.1 -> 95.0.2-> 96).

i have windows 11 x64 and a fast desktop system (cpu intel i7 9700k, ssd m2, gpu msi gtx 1660 ti).

i simply ran firefox setup 96.0 full installer [1]

ps. i also reported the issue in http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=3083857


actual results:

after update completed, when i first launched firefox, there was a white screen for 30 sec and then eventually the firefox ui was displayed.
note that the white screen issue only occurred right after update, never on subsequent ff launches.

the issue occurs consistently on my everyday ff profile: 
if i completely uninstall +reinstall 96.0
and remove the two directories:
- c:\users\user\appdata\roaming\mozilla
- c:\users\user\appdata\local\mozilla
and then restore the former directory from my backup,
then the 30 sec white screen occurs consistently on first ff launch.

the issue doesn't occur on a fresh ff profile.
if any dev would like to test, i could email my everyday ff profile to him.

the white screen should only appear momentarily, as in previous ff versions.","I'd rate this bug report as ""good"". Here's why:

1. **Content**: The report provides a clear description of the issue, including relevant details about the environment (Windows 11, Firefox version, etc.). The steps to reproduce are well-documented, making it easy for developers to replicate the issue.
2. **Grammar**: The text is well-written and free of grammatical errors.
3. **Steps to Reproduce (S2R)**: Present and detailed, with a clear description of what the reporter did to trigger the issue.
4. **Expected Result (ER)**: Clearly stated what the reporter expected to happen.
5. **Actual Result (AR)**: A thorough description of what actually happened.

The only thing missing is the ""Additional Information"" section, which would typically include details like software version, build number, environment, etc. However, this information is already provided in the S2R and AR sections.

So, I've been noticing an issue with Firefox updates - specifically, whenever I upgrade from one version to the next (I've gone from 93 to 94, then 95, and now 96). It happens on my Windows 11 machine, which has a pretty sweet setup: Intel i7 CPU, M2 SSD, and MSI GTX 1660 Ti graphics card. To be specific, I'm running Firefox 95.0.2 with all the usual extensions enabled (16 of them, to be exact). 

When I recently updated to Firefox 96 using the full installer from Mozilla's FTP site, things got weird. When I launched the browser for the first time after the update, it took about 30 seconds for the UI to appear - and instead, there was a white screen staring back at me! This only happened on that initial launch, by the way; subsequent launches didn't have the same issue.

Here's the kicker: if I completely uninstall Firefox 96, reinstall it, delete the relevant Mozilla directories (AppData/Roaming and Local), and then restore my backup profile from before, I can reproduce this white screen issue consistently. It only happens with my everyday profile, mind you - a fresh profile doesn't exhibit this behavior.

I've also reported this to the Mozilla forums (you can check out that thread at http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=3083857). If any developers want to test this issue, I'd be happy to send over my everyday Firefox profile for them to try out! 

What's expected here is that the white screen would only pop up briefly, like it did in older Firefox versions."

So, I'm experiencing this weird issue with Firefox Nightly on my Android 11 device (OnePlus A6000). Here's what's going on: when I open a private browsing window (with a clean profile, mind you) and head to https://temp-number.org/app/, the page just loads up blank. There's nothing there - no content, no error message, just a blank screen. I've attached a screenshot of this empty page as attachment 9284523.

Now, here are some details that might be helpful: I can reproduce this issue consistently on Firefox Nightly in private browsing mode, but it doesn't happen when I use Chrome incognito mode. Interestingly, the same thing happens on Firefox Release (non-nightly) when I'm also in private window mode. However, if I browse normally (without private mode), neither Firefox Nightly nor Release exhibit this behavior."

""So, I'm seeing an issue with the focus ring on the about:logins page.

So I was testing out an Italian-localized Firefox nightly build (version 89) on Windows 10 when I hit this issue. Basically, if you open up the menu and look at the keyboard shortcuts - like, for example, Ctrl+Shift+F is shortened to ""Ctrl+Shift+F"" in Italian - they don't fit within the available space because they're just too long. This happens even though there's plenty of room on the screen. It's weird because if I were using a Mac, I'd actually see single keys as icons instead, which would make more sense (you can check out some pictures I attached to get an idea). Anyways, what I'm expecting is that the menu could just expand to accommodate those long strings or, you know, maybe even split them across two lines so they don't get cut off."

So, I've got a weird issue with Firefox 91.0 on my Linux machine. I was using Firefox 80 and then upgraded to 81, which caused some problems (I filed bug #1667464). But after updating to v83.0, everything worked fine again.

Fast forward to when I updated from Firefox 90.0.2 to 91.0 - that's when things got weird. My Sony WH-XB900N headset stopped working properly with web conferencing software like 3CX and Webex during calls or meetings. It didn't matter if I gave permission for the mic temporarily or permanently; it just wouldn't work.

I've tried using a new profile and no extensions at all, but still, the problem persists. The speaker works fine, but the microphone is always muted! It's like it's stuck on mute or something.

I went back to Firefox 90.0.2, rebooted, and my headset worked again without any issues. So, I'm pretty sure this is a regression that happened between v90.0.2 and v91.0.

Here are the steps to reproduce:

1. Update from Firefox 90.0.2 to 91.0.
2. Reboot your machine.
3. Connect your headset (in my case, Sony WH-XB900N).
4. Go to a web conferencing site and grant access to the microphone.
5. Make a call or start a meeting - the mic should work, but it doesn't.

In short, upgrading from Firefox 90.0.2 to 91.0 broke the usability of my Bluetooth microphone. Lots of noise and the voice is unrecognizable. I hope someone can help me figure out what's going on!"

So, I've got a weird issue going on with Firefox - when I launch it with the profile manager, select an existing profile, and check the ""work offline"" box, something's off. Specifically, the checkbox itself becomes bigger and the checkmark inside it starts to look like it's made up of tiny pixels instead of being a smooth mark. This happens on my Windows 10 machine with Firefox versions 109.0.1, 110.0, and even the latest dev build (111.0a1). I've tried it on Ubuntu 22 and macOS 10.15, but the issue only shows up when I'm running it on Windows. It's also worth noting that if I set my display scale to 100% instead of 125%, the problem disappears. Anyway, you can see what I mean by checking out the attached screenshot (checkbox.png)."

i have watched requests on a web page. i tried to select media files by clicking on the ""media"" switch. ogg files (content-type audio/ogg) are not displayed when the ""media"" filter is on, these files are displayed only when ""all"" or ""other"" is selected.
this does not happen when i watch requests a file with the ""mp3"" extension (content-type audio/mpeg). when i select the ""media"" switch i can see audio/mpeg requests in the list.

the attached image shows the request that returns audio/ogg content-type from the initiator ""media"". if i select the ""media"" switch (red between ""images"" and ""ws""), then this request will not appear in the list. (some private headers are masked.)

3923,"today, gecko developers need to go through quite a few steps still to build fenix locally if they make platform changes and want to test them out on mobile apps.

### steps to reproduce

1. `mach build`
2. setup `java_home` and `android_home` environment variables (because these cannot be found unless you use `mach gradle`).
3. [generate a signing key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key) (with cli instructions are probably somewhere close to that link).
4.  add `autosignreleasewithdebugkey` to `mobile/android/{android_app}/local.properties`.
5.  `cd mobile/android/fenix`
6. `./gradlew installfenixrelease` 

### expected behaviour
* after `mach build`, you should be able to build (from the root or project directory) any of the mobile projects without needing more environment configurations outside of  `mach bootstrap`.
* you should not need to do step 2, 3, or 5.
* at step 6, you should be able to use `mach gradle installfenixrelease`  instead.

### device information

* firefox version: n/a
* android device model: n/a
* android os version: n/a

### any additional information?
* `android_home` is needed because the `sdk.dir` property in `local.properties` is created by android studio.
* `java_home` is needed if you are going to execute `gradlew` in one of the app projects.
* both of the above would not need to be set if we can get `mach gradle` to recognize these projects from the root gradle.","Here's my assessment:

To reproduce this, you can try disabling ""show animations"" in your Windows 10 display settings, or tick the ""reduce motion"" box under display preferences on a Mac. Alternatively, just set the ""ui.prefersreducedmotion"" setting to 1 in Firefox's about:config page and restart the browser.

Then, click ""open folder"", copy that user.js file into the profile you just opened, restart the browser, and you should see that the user is now enrolled in the experiment. After restarting, open a new tab and notice that the bookmark toolbar is there - and weirdly enough, there's also this ""finish setup"" button on it.

Now, my expected result was that the onboarding checklist experiment would only target Windows users, but what actually happened was that it targeted all OSes (Windows, macOS, Linux). I've attached a video of this issue so you can see for yourself. And, just to add, this issue also happens on Linux machines."

**[notes]:**
- this issue is **not** reproducible on windows 11 x64, macos 11.6, and linux mint 20.2 x64.

**[affected versions]:**
- firefox release 99.0.1 - build id: 20220411174855
- firefox beta 100.0 - build id: 20220428192727
- firefox nightly 101.0a1 - build id: 20220428214715

**[affected platforms]:**
- windows 10 x64
- windows 8.1 x64

**[prerequisites]:**
- have a firefox profile with the ""browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.devtoolsenabled"" pref set to ""true"" in the ""about:config"" page.

**[steps to reproduce]:**
1. open the browser using the profile from the prerequisites.
2. navigate to the ""about:newtab#asrouter"" page.
3. search for the ""peace-of-mind-a-rollout-global"" and click the ""show"" button.
4. observe the spotlight.

**[expected result]:**
- the ""eco"" spotlight is successfully displayed and all the elements are visible.

**[actual result]:**
- scrollbars are wrongly displayed inside the default ""eco"" spotlight.

**[regression window]:**
- this issue is not reproducible with the firefox release 98.0.2 version. considering this using the mozregression tool i have managed to find the following regression window:
last good revision: 1f27d80f3ad1b439bfb1fc3d359306de32ffbfe4

So, I've got an issue to report - it seems that in Firefox versions 99.0.1 and up (including beta and nightly builds), there's a problem with the ""eco"" spotlight when you have certain browser settings enabled. Specifically, if you've set the ""browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.devtoolsenabled"" preference to true in your about:config page, you'll see scrollbars displayed inside the default ""eco"" spotlight when you navigate to the about:newtab#asrouter page and search for ""peace-of-mind-a-rollout-global"". This shouldn't be happening - instead of seeing all the elements as expected, you're getting these weird scrollbars. I've tried this on Windows 10 and 8.1, but it doesn't seem to happen on other platforms or with older versions of Firefox (like 98.0.2). Interestingly, it looks like this issue started showing up after a certain change was made in the code - bug 1758187 seems to be the culprit here.

steps to reproduce:

1.	how your ca first became aware of the problem (e.g. via a problem report submitted to your problem reporting mechanism, a discussion in mozilla.dev.security.policy, a bugzilla bug, or internal self-audit), and the time and date.
identrust: 
between 9/27/2021 and 10/2/2021 while coordinating and formulating a remediation plan for bug 1734917, we determined that revoking the certificates identified in bug 1734917 within 5 days will have resulted in significant impact to the affected customer’s production services that utilized the identified certificates.   in our risk management review, we noted that these certificates, while mis-issued, posed very low security risk as the information present in the certificates had been all validated.  based on this assessment, we did not revoke the mis-issued certificates within 5 days as required by b.r.  

2.	a timeline of the actions your ca took in response. a timeline is a date-and-time-stamped sequence of all relevant events. this may include events before the incident was reported, such as when a particular requirement became applicable, or a document changed, or a bug was introduced, or an audit was done.
identrust: 
• 9/28/2021: risk management review of and approval of remediation plan which included revocation of identified certificates within 30 days instead of 5 days.
• 10/18/2021: we were reminded via comment #2 in bug 1734917 that revocation beyond 5 days requires a separate incident report. 

3.	whether your ca has stopped, or has not yet stopped, issuing certificates with the problem. a statement that you have will be considered a pledge to the community; a statement that you have not requires an explanation.
identrust:  
yes, see bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1734917

4.	a summary of the problematic certificates. for each problem: number of certs, and the date the first and last certs with that problem were issued.
identrust: 
see bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1734917

5.	the complete certificate data for the problematic certificates. the recommended way to provide this is to ensure each certificate is logged to ct and then list the fingerprints or crt.sh ids, either in the report or as an attached spreadsheet, with one list per distinct problem.
identrust: 
see attachment in bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1734917

6.	explanation about how and why the mistakes were made or bugs introduced, and how they avoided detection until now.
identrust: 
as the re-issued ev ssl certificates have the same information as the original ev ssl certificates, we determined that the identified certificates posed low, if any, security risk to the customers and relying party(s).  we also needed to balance impact to customers and revocation within 5 days was too onerous as the identified certificates supported production services for well-established customers.  as such we are executing a plan that requires  revocation within 30 days.  the process in place failed to include the step to file a separate incident report. 

7.	list of steps your ca is taking to resolve the situation and ensure such issuance will not be repeated in the future, accompanied with a timeline of when your ca expects to accomplish these things.
identrust: 
we have updated the process to include filing a separate incident report in the instance when it is determined that ca or subscriber certificates expected to be revoked within 24 hours or five days does not take place as a result of a remediation plan of another separate incident","""good""",14,16,87.5,False,0,True,1,False,0,True,1,False,0,False,0,True,2,True,1,True,1,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,2,"Here's the rewritten bug report:

So, here's what happened: between September 27th and October 2nd, we were working on figuring out how to fix the problem with those mis-issued EV SSL certificates (bug #1734917). We realized that if we revoked them within 5 days, it would cause a huge impact to some of our customers who rely heavily on those certificates for their production services. Since these certificates didn't pose a significant security risk because all the information in them was already validated, we decided not to revoke them right away and instead came up with a plan to do so within 30 days.

Here's what happened next:

* On September 28th, we did a risk management review and approved a remediation plan that included revoking the certificates within 30 days.
* Then, on October 18th, someone reminded us via comment #2 in bug #1734917 that if we're going to take longer than 5 days to revoke the certificates, we need to file a separate incident report.

We haven't stopped issuing certificates with this problem - we've actually got a plan in place to fix it. You can check out more details about that plan in bug #1734917.

steps to reproduce:

in windows settings, change mouse pointer size to any size 3 or higher.
mouse over an element that has a tool-tip.


actual results:

the offset of the tool-tip is not great enough for the larger cursor size, so the beginning of the tool-tip is covered up by the cursor and can't be read.

i can't provide a screenshot or video of this because the cursor size appears different in screen recordings. instead, i have a picture taken of the actual screen.

So I was messing around with my Windows settings and changed the mouse pointer size to something bigger than usual (think 3 or higher). Then, I hovered over an element that had a tooltip - you know, one of those pop-up hints that shows up when you hover over something. What happened next was weird: because my cursor is so big now, it covers up part of the tooltip! The beginning of the text gets hidden behind the cursor and it's impossible to read what it says. I tried taking a screenshot or recording a video, but even those look different from what I'm seeing on my screen - the cursor size seems to mess with the recording software. Anyway, what I was expecting was that the tooltip would automatically move away from the mouse cursor enough so I could actually see what it's saying."

1. enable nvda screen reader (same result with jaws).
2. launch firefox and open this url:
   `data:text/html,<div id=""test"" class=""test"">test</div>`
3. make sure you are in browse mode and use left/right arrow keys until 's' letter for example.
4. press nvda+f1 and focus on ""developer info for navigator object"" section, then ""iaccessible2 attributes"" value (at the bottom).



actual results:

	- next launches  (ko): 'tag:div;display:block;id:test;'

notes:

- initial launch = right after installing firefox.
- prior to version 111.0, it worked as expected every time.

in other words, starting from firefox version 111.0 and after its initial launch, a significant number of attributes are not exposed through the iaccessible2 api, such as the 'class' attribute.

""When I enabled the NVDA screen reader (and even tried it with JAWS for good measure), I noticed something weird happening with Firefox.

On initial launches of versions 111.0 through 114.0, I see a bunch of attributes exposed - stuff like 'margin-top:0px;display:block;tag:div;margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;class:test;formatting:block;id:test;margin-bottom:0px;', but subsequent launches only show me the bare minimum, like 'tag:div;display:block;id:test;'. It's not just a one-time thing, either - this started happening from Firefox version 111.0 onwards, and it didn't used to happen before that.

So, I've been experiencing this weird issue with Firefox Nightly on my Nokia C03 running Android 10. It started happening after I updated to the latest nightly build around August 3-4.

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (x11; linux x86_64; rv:78.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/78.0

steps to reproduce:

1. subscribe to a caldav calendar with thunderbird (i use baikal 0.8.0).
2. open the following ics file (produced by timeanddate.com) with thunderbird and attempt to add the event to your caldav calendar:
https://pintoch.ulminfo.fr/f43036d480/event_with_uri_as_uid.ics (also attached in this bug report)


actual results:

the event is not added to the calendar, with no error message.
(if the ics file was received as an email attachment and i tried to add it by clicking the ""add"" button next in the ""this message contains an event"" banner, then i get the error message ""processing message failed. status: 80004005."" which is really not informative at all)



expected results:

first, better error reporting is need. i would expect something like ""this event could not be added to the calendar ""my calendar"". the server responded with 404 error, calendar object not found.""

then, i would of course expect the event to actually be added to the calendar. the reason why this fails is that the ics file contains a url in the ""uid"" field, and thunderbird constructs the caldav url for the event by including this uid in the url without sufficient escaping or sanitization:
https://my.baikal.instance.com/cal.php/calendars/my_calendar/default/http%3a//www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html%3fiso%3d20210720t1400%26msg%3dreconciliation%20cg%20july%20meeting.ics

i believe the ""/"" character should be escaped as well.

Here's what happens: I follow the usual steps - subscribing to the calendar with Thunderbird, opening the .ics file, and trying to add it to my calendar.

What I expect to happen is that Thunderbird should give me some kind of error message explaining what went wrong (like ""This event couldn't be added to your calendar 'My Calendar'. The server responded with a 404 error, calendar object not found""). And of course, the event should actually get added to my calendar! But it doesn't.

steps to reproduce:

this report is about a firefox's bug in opt-in process of oe (opportunistic encryption, rfc 8164).

let's say the association between 80 (unencrypted) and 443 (encrypted) is made by opt-in checking using .well-known json. then content from port 443 (i.e. alternative service) is treated as if it is provided from port 80. it means, by design, opted-in encrypted content can be read by unencrypted content thanks to same origin policy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
■example.jp (ipaddr: 1.1.1.1)
80 - open to the internet. /.well-known/http-opportunistic is placed.
443 (h2) - same as port 80.
8443 (tls) - it serves secret file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

the problem is that firefox performs opt-in checking only in the first h2 connection to alternative service. this means active network attacker can forward second or sebsequent connection to a port other than 443 (8443 port above, encrypted, not opted-in). the encrypted content from 8443 port can be read by unencrypted content. this way, firefox's implementation of oe put non opted-in tls ports at risk.

an attack example is as follows. the attacker controls dns records and has a server (2.2.2.2) on the internet. port 8443 on example.jp (1.1.1.1) is the attack target.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
■attacker's server (ipaddr: 2.2.2.2)
80 - it serves a copy of .well-known json file and a page for attack.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)
attacker manipulates dns record: example.jp. 0 in a 2.2.2.2.
attacker configures port forwarding: 2.2.2.2:8443 to 1.1.1.1:443.

(2)
victim user navigates to http://example.jp/ (2.2.2.2).

> alt-svc: h2=""example.jp:8443""; ma=120
> 
> <iframe src=""/test""></iframe>
> <script>
> // get iframe source repeatedly
> setinterval(() => {
>     var i = frames[0];
>     i.location.reload();
>     settimeout(() => {console.log(i.document.body.textcontent)}, 1000);
> }, 5000);
> </script>

opt-in is ok because h2 connection to example.jp:8443 (2.2.2.2:8443) is forwarded to 1.1.1.1:443.

(3)
attacker restores dns record: example.jp. 0 in a 1.1.1.1.
attacker then shuts down port forwarding running at 2.2.2.2:8443.
javascript in (2) now fetches content from 8443 tls with no errors.

possible fix for this issue is to perform opt-in checking upon every new h2 connection to alternative service (obviously, non opted-in ports could detect this kind of attack by checking alt-used or host header (port number), but necessity for such defense is not mentioned in rfc).

one more thing to note is that, incompliant with last paragraph of rfc 7838 section 2.4, firefox checks alpn protocol name only on the first connection to alternative service. in other words, no protocol name checking is performed in the second and subsequent connections (same goes for upgrading http/1.1 tls to h2). this increases the possibility of successful exploitation including cross-protocol attack, so it's safer to limit alternative service connections to h2/h3 only.","I would rate this bug report as ""good"". Here's why:

* The report provides a clear description of the issue, including relevant background information on the Opportunistic Encryption (OE) feature in Firefox.
* It includes a detailed example of an attack scenario that demonstrates the problem, including step-by-step instructions and code snippets. This helps to illustrate the vulnerability and makes it easier for developers to understand and reproduce the issue.
* The report provides some potential fixes or mitigations for the issue, which can help developers to start working on a solution.

The only thing missing is the Expected Result (ER) section, which describes what the reporter expected to happen. However, since the report is already quite detailed and easy to follow, I wouldn't consider this omission a major drawback.",14,16,87.5,False,0,True,1,False,0,True,1,True,1,True,1,True,2,False,0,False,0,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,2,"Here's a rewritten version of the bug report in a conversational tone:

""I'm reporting a weird issue with Firefox's opportunistic encryption (OE) feature, specifically how it handles opt-in checking when switching between unencrypted and encrypted ports.

Let me explain what I mean. Imagine we've set up an association between port 80 (unencrypted) and port 443 (encrypted) using the .well-known JSON file. When content from port 443 is treated as if it's coming from port 80, thanks to same origin policy, we can read opted-in encrypted content in unencrypted content.

Here's a concrete example: let's say we have a website at IP address 1.1.1.1 (example.jp) with ports 80 and 443 both serving the same content. We also have a secret file served on port 8443 over TLS. Now, an attacker can forward my connection to port 8443, which isn't opted-in, allowing them to read the encrypted content.

The problem is that Firefox only performs opt-in checking for the first H2 connection to alternative service, meaning an active network attacker can easily forward subsequent connections to a different port (like port 8443) without me even realizing it. This means my encrypted content on port 8443 could be accessed by unencrypted content.

Here's how I think this attack would work: the attacker controls DNS records and has a server at IP address 2.2.2.2. They'd manipulate DNS to point example.jp to their own server, then set up port forwarding from their server's port 8443 to my original port 443 on example.jp. When I navigate to http://example.jp/, the browser would opt-in to the encrypted connection and forward subsequent requests to the attacker's server.

To test this out, I'd open a new tab with an iframe that repeatedly reloads itself and logs the content of the page every second. Initially, the browser would perform opt-in checking correctly, but once the port forwarding is restored, the JavaScript in the iframe would start fetching content from the unencrypted port 8443 without any errors.

One possible fix for this issue would be to re-check for opt-in on every new H2 connection to alternative service. This might seem obvious, but it's not explicitly mentioned in RFC 8164. Additionally, Firefox only checks ALPN protocol names on the first connection to alternative service, which increases the risk of successful exploitation including cross-protocol attacks. To mitigate this, we could limit alternative service connections to H2/H3 only."""

a simple python server

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (x11; ubuntu; linux x86_64; rv:91.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/91.0

steps to reproduce:

create a simple localhost http server with wsgiref in python.
visit the website in private mode with firefox (on either localhost:8000 or 127.0.0.1:8000)
there is no problem with wget (and no problem with chromium if i remember correctly). if you use the local network address for the server instead of localhost it is fast.
i used ubuntu 20.04


actual results:

firefox opens two connections, one of which does not send data. this is problematic when doing web development because simple webservers have only one worker. it takes 5 seconds to display the page. this only happens when clicking enter in the address bar, if you press f5 or ctrl f5 there is no problem. it also happens if you click enter again.
using strace on the example program the syscall recvfrom appears to be blocked for about 5 seconds and gets no data.
recvfrom(4, """", 8192, 0, null, null)    = 0
shutdown(4, shut_wr)                    = 0
close(4)                                = 0
the program then accepts a second connection and firefox displays the page


expected results:

i think there should be only one connection or maybe the first connection should do something. the web page should be displayed almost immediately. in normal browsing there is only one connection and the display of the page is almost immediate.","Here's my evaluation:

""I'm seeing a weird issue with a simple Python server I created using wsgiref. When I visit the site in private mode on Firefox (specifically, 91.0), it behaves strangely. If I enter the URL into the address bar and hit Enter, two connections are established - one of which just sits there without sending any data. This is a problem because simple webservers like mine can only handle one worker at a time. It takes around 5 seconds for the page to load, which is way slower than what I'd expect from normal browsing. The weird thing is that if I press F5 or Ctrl + F5 instead of hitting Enter, everything works fine - it's just when I hit Enter again that I see this issue. When I used strace on my Python program, I noticed that the `recvfrom` syscall seems to be blocked for about 5 seconds and doesn't receive any data before finally shutting down and closing the connection. It looks like Firefox is trying to establish a second connection or something? Anyway, after waiting out the 5-second delay, the page does load eventually. What I expect is that there should only be one connection established when I hit Enter, or at least for the first connection to do some kind of handshake before the page loads. That's how it usually works in normal browsing."""

steps to reproduce:

newly install firefox desktop on any platform (this occurred recently when setting up both firefox on a new work laptop running macos and when setting up a new personal computer running fedora).
sign into sync as suggested in the initial onboarding flow.
complete login including 2fa, etc.



actual results:

onboarding shows a screen stating i should install firefox on my other devices and sync, with options ""get started"" or ""i'll do this later, send me a reminder"" and no other options. 
clicking ""get started"" brings me to the next screen, telling me to scan a qr code with my phone camera to install firefox there, or showing an option reading ""i'll do this later, send me a reminder"" again.
clicking ""i'll do this later"" on either screen results in multiple spammy emails reminding me to install firefox on other devices, even if i already have many devices synced with my firefox account.


expected results:

ideally, there should be some option to say either ""i don't want to set up sync,"" ""i already have firefox synced on multiple devices"", or both at the initial onboarding screen. leaving out this option is arguably a ""dark pattern,"" forcing users to take some action either now or later, with no explicit option to simply say ""i don't want to take this action at all"" or do it at another time without a reminder. while the goal of encouraging users to set up sync with other devices for their own security and data loss-prevention is admirable, it seems contrary to the spirit of mozilla, and freedom of choice for users, to push it this hard. it is also quite annoying to go through this process as a long-time user and receive several unnecessary email reminders every time i install firefox on a new device, even though i already have sync set up on many devices.","**Good**

I found this weird issue while testing out some new features in Firefox. It happened on three different platforms - Windows 10, macOS, and Ubuntu 22 - but not on any other ones I tried (don't know which ones those are yet, though!). The problem only shows up when you're using either the nightly or beta versions of Firefox, specifically v122.0a1 and v121.0b2. 

To reproduce it, follow these steps: first, flip a switch in the settings to enable the new webcompat reporter (just set `ui.new-webcompat-reporter.enabled` to true), then set the ""send more info"" link to be visible too (`ui.new-webcompat-reporter.send-more-info-link = true`). Then load any webpage you like. Next, open up the webcompat reporter tool and use your keyboard to navigate over to the ""send more info"" link - it should be reachable by arrowing over to it or hitting the enter key if you're using one of those fancy keyboards that can do that kind of thing.

What I expected to happen is that I'd be able to click on that link with my keyboard (either with the space bar or enter key). But what actually happens is that I can reach the link just fine, but it won't respond when I try to interact with it using those keys. It's like it's ignoring me! 

This isn't a new issue that popped up in some recent version of Firefox - it's been around since at least beta v121.0b1.

Finally, take a look at the text of the 'import error' modal that pops up. The weird part is that when I do this, the font of the 'Learn more' link seems to have gotten thicker - it's not as thin as I expect according to the documentation (check out [this screenshot](https://mozilla.invisionapp.com/share/r3xx2af2xn5#/screens/423736091) for a comparison)."""

I thought they would automatically disappear after a few seconds, but nope, they just kept hovering over the video, making it hard to focus on what I was watching. Here's what happened: I went to a page with a video, started playing it, and then popped it out into picture-in-picture mode. Then, I double-clicked on the video to zoom in, and waited for a bit without moving or clicking my mouse. What I expected to happen is that the pip controls would fade away after a few seconds, letting me enjoy the video uninterrupted. But instead, they just stuck around, covering up part of the video - Mozilla/Firefox 5.0 on Linux, with a window size of 1920x923, if you're wondering what I was using."

To reproduce the problem, you'll need to have some specific settings enabled: `browser.search.region` set to ""us"" (which means you'll need to be connected to a VPN if you're outside of the US), `browser.urlbar.quicksuggest.rustenabled` and `browser.urlbar.suggest.yelp` both set to true, and `browser.urlbar.yelp.featuregate` and `browser.urlbar.yelp.priority` also enabled.

To see the issue, follow these steps: open Firefox with that specific profile, type ""sushi"" into the address bar, click the feedback button, dismiss a suggestion by clicking one of the ""not relevant"" or ""not interested"" options, and then look at how the message is displayed. What I expect to happen is that the Firefox icon and the text ""thanks for your feedback"" should be centered horizontally in the middle of the message row.

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:78.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/78.0

steps to reproduce:

- install firefox, sign in, and enable syncing on an ios device (ipad and iphone tested), an desktop device (multiple windows 10 and macos big sur tested), and any other device (mobile or desktop).
- go into the firefox settings on the ios and desktop devices and change the device name
- verify that the device names have changed on the account (https://accounts.firefox.com, press ""sync now"" to push the change on any devices if necessary)
- open the ""synced tabs"" window on the third device


actual results:

in any ""synced tabs"" menu (including the sidebar and list under any ""library"" option) the name of the x86 device has changed but the ios device still shows the original name.


expected results:

the name of the ios device should have changed to whatever it was set to, just like it does for other devices.

note: though this issue only seems to affect ios devices, i do not believe it is actually an issue with firefox for ios but rather with the ""synced tabs"" menu/bars everywhere as the issue is visible in these menus on ios as well as the desktop, which is why i am submitting it as a firefox bug and not a firefox for ios bug

note 2: the attached file is a screenshot of my ""synced tabs"" bard showing the list of the devices syncing to my account (with a few personal names blacked out). as you can see, both the ios devices are named ""firefox on ____'s (device)"" even though the names for both devices have been changed to just ""iphone"" and ""ipad"" (ie i removed the ""firefox on ____'s""), and those changes are properly reflected in the account settings.","Here's my assessment:

Hey, I've got a weird issue with Firefox syncing across multiple devices!

Instead, it still says ""Firefox on ____'s (device)"" even though I've changed it in the settings. This is true whether I'm looking at the sidebar or the list of synced tabs under a library option. The weird part is that this only seems to affect iOS devices - my desktop devices and other non-iOS devices show the updated names just fine.

93,"i am experiencing this decade-old bug on firefox 86.0 (64-bit) stable release, windows 10 pro.

pdfs are displayed with proper scale in firefox built-in pdf viewer. however some files appear shrunk in the top left corner of the viewer of the redesigned print preview screen and they are printed accordingly.

""fit to page width"" and ""scale: 100% options"" don't fix this behavior. setting manually the print scale at 127% circa results in the affected pdf being displayed and printed with correct proportions. see the attachments.

also worth mentioning that in about:config all the ""print_scaling"" values are set correctly at 1.

steps to reproduce:

1. download and open with firefox one of the problematic pdf files (ex. https://www.academia.edu/44947095/desde_la_periferia_mujeres_de_la_ilustraci%c3%b3n_en_province_ or other random pdf files)

expected results:

I'm experiencing this weird issue with Firefox 86.0 (64-bit) on Windows 10 Pro. It seems like it's been around for ages! So, here's what's happening: when I open a PDF in Firefox and go to print preview, some files are displayed way too small in the top left corner of the viewer area, and when I actually print them, they're shrunk just the same. Weirdly enough, if I manually set the print scale to around 127%, it fixes the issue and shows me the correct proportions.

I've tried playing around with the options - ""fit to page width"" and ""scale: 100%"" don't make a difference. And just to confirm, all my print scaling settings in about:config are set correctly at 1. I've attached some files for reference.

To reproduce this issue:

1. Download and open one of those problematic PDFs (like the ones from Academia.edu or other random PDFs) using Firefox
2. Click on the printer icon to open the print preview screen
3. The actual PDF page is shrunk in the top left corner of the viewer area 
4. Choosing ""fit to page width"" or ""scale: 100%"" doesn't change anything
5. When I click ""print"", the PDF page remains shrunk on the printed page

What I expect to happen:

The PDF file should be previewed and printed with correct proportions, just like it does in other browsers or PDF viewers.

What actually happens:

The PDF page is shrunk in the top left corner of the viewer area in print preview, and when I print it, it's still tiny.

(P.S. - I used ""Microsoft Print to PDF"" as my printer for privacy reasons, but the issue persists regardless of the selected printer.)"

If I hide the window manager's title bar (you know, that top part of the screen) and try to drag the Firefox title bar around again using my touchscreen, suddenly scrolling and zooming stop working too.

1. set the device to german.
2. open fenix nightly - settings - search - and set ecosia the default search engine.
3. exit settings, and search for a term (i.e. photo, puma, etc).
4. tap on one of the search results, then send the app in the background.
5. send the metrics using the correct command in android studio, and verify the glean dashboard for the browser.search.in_content, browser.search.with_ads, and the browser.search.ad_clicks metrics.

### expected behavior
the metrics are generated if a search is performed, and a sponsored page is being tapped on and opened.

### actual behavior
neither of the three browser.search metrics are being generated - [glean dashboard](https://debug-ping-preview.firebaseapp.com/pings/miraandroidecosia).

### device information
* firefox version: nightly 124.0a1 from 2/7
* android device: google pixel 8 (android 14)

currently the testcase is works most of the time on linux (default settings) and windows (with fullscreen transition disabled), but it still intermittent on transition enabled, even so we can ask the victim to try again (e.g. ""you're a robot, please try again"") until the spoof is success.

""So I've got this weird issue where if you set `document.documentElement.hidden` to `true`, load an iframe with some HTML code (`srcdoc` property), and then try to go into fullscreen mode by calling `element.requestFullscreen()`, the browser will suddenly go into fullscreen without giving any notification that says something like 'this website is now in fullscreen mode'. This can be super sneaky because it means someone could unknowingly put my whole webpage in fullscreen, which would hide the address bar and make it easier to spoof the UI. 

The weird thing is, this issue only happens sometimes - on Linux, it works most of the time with default settings, but on Windows, even when I disable the transition animation, it still doesn't work consistently. And if it does fail, I can just ask the user to try again until they get the spoof to work.

Hey, so I'm reporting a weird issue I found in Firefox. So, when you open any PDF and start highlighting some text, then try to ""free highlight"" (you know, where you just draw over whatever) from an area that doesn't have text, it starts working fine. But here's the thing: if your free highlight crosses over an already highlighted area of text, it just stops working altogether! Like, I was expecting it to keep going and let me highlight on top of other highlights, but nope - it just gives up. This happened in the nightly build 124.0a1 from February 7th, and I tried it on all platforms (so, all devices) and got the same result.

""I'm reporting a weird issue I found while trying to use autofill for credit card info on The North Face Italy website (https://www.thenorthface.it). It happens when you're using version 111.0-candidates and have at least one saved credit card already. To reproduce the problem, just follow these steps: go to the payment form on that site, click on the ""card number"" field, and see what happens. What should happen is that autofill should pop up with the saved CC info, but instead, it doesn't trigger at all! This only happens when using Windows 10, and I've tested on other platforms (like Chrome) where it works fine. Just a heads up: I couldn't find any connection to this issue being related to any specific browser or platform changes."""

sec-fetch-local.html

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (x11; ubuntu; linux x86_64; rv:92.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/92.0

steps to reproduce:

for localhost and ips, requests to localhost/the same ip with a different port the sec-fetch-site header of the request is cross-site instead of same-site.

- download the attached file
- run a local web server on port 9898 (e.g., `php -s 0.0.0.0:9898`)
- visit http://localhost:9898/sec-fetch-local.html
- open the dev tools and observe the sec-fetch-site header of the requests
(- visit https://demo.websec.saarland/static/sec-fetch-realsite.html to check a non-localhost site
- change localhost to 127.0.0.1 in the local file and visit http://127.0.0.1:9898/sec-fetch-local.html)


actual results:

the request to http://localhost:9000 from http://localhost:9898 has the header `sec-fetch-site: cross-site`.
the request to http://sub.localhost:9898 from http://localhost:9898 has the header `sec-fetch-site: cross-site`.

for ips (e.g., 127.0.0.1) the same happens for ports, subdomains are not applicable.
for a real site (e.g., demo.websec.saarland), requests with a different port or subdomain have `sec-fech-site: same-site`.

requests to the same-origin always have `sec-fetch-site: same-origin`.


expected results:

the requests to the same-site (only port differs) should have `sec-fetch-site: same-site` for localhost and ips. 

localhost is not a proper domain, so subdomains only make limited sense. however, firefox and other browsers still resolve sub.localhost, so it might make sense to send `sec-fetch-site: same-site` instead of `cross-site` on these requests to not confuse developers doing local testing.

chrome currently sends `same-site` for a different port (different to firefox) and `cross-site` for a localhost ""sub""domain (same as firefox).",Best,16,16,100.0,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,True,1,True,1,True,2,False,0,True,1,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,2,"Here's the rewritten bug report:

I've noticed something weird with the `sec-fetch-site` header in Firefox. When I visit a local webpage on a different port, say `http://localhost:9898/sec-fetch-local.html`, the `sec-fetch-site` header is set to `cross-site` instead of `same-site`. This happens whether I'm using `localhost` or an IP address like `127.0.0.1`. For example, if I run a local web server on port 9898 and visit `http://localhost:9898/sec-fetch-local.html`, the request has the `sec-fetch-site: cross-site` header. If I change the port to 9000 or try `http://sub.localhost:9898/sec-fetch-local.html`, I still get `cross-site`. It's like Firefox thinks these requests are coming from a different website altogether!

But here's the thing - when I visit a real website on a different port or subdomain, say `https://demo.websec.saarland/static/sec-fetch-realsite.html`, Firefox correctly sets the `sec-fetch-site` header to `same-site`. And if I make a request from the same origin (e.g., `http://localhost:9898`), it always says `sec-fetch-site: same-origin`.

So, what I'm expecting is that when I visit a local webpage on a different port (but still on the same site), Firefox should set the `sec-fetch-site` header to `same-site`. It makes sense, since this is just like visiting a real website with multiple ports or subdomains. Right now, it's setting it to `cross-site`, which can be confusing for developers doing local testing.

By the way, Chrome behaves differently here - it sets the `sec-fetch-site` header to `same-site` when I visit a local webpage on a different port, and `cross-site` when I try to access a ""sub"" domain like `localhost`. So, Firefox is actually consistent with its behavior in this regard!"

- i was not able to reproduce this issue on firefox beta 112.0b4 (build id - 20230319180129) using multiple new profiles which i restarted and reopened several times.
- i am not able to find a regression range due to the fact that each time a build is open through the program, it resets the “nightly data collection and use” options from `about:preferences#privacy`. because of this, i get unenrolled from the experiment and can’t reproduce the issue.
- i tried the str using an older nightly build 112.0a1 (feb. 25) and the issue is also reproducible there.

**[affected versions]:**
- firefox nightly 113.0a1 - build id: 20230321091911
- firefox nightly 112.0a1 - build id: 20230225205757

**[affected platforms]:**
- windows 10 x64
- macos 12.4
- linux ubuntu 20.04 x64

**[prerequisites]:**
- have a vpn client connected to an us server (for people located outside the us).
- have the `nimbus.debug` pref set to `true`.
- session restore is not enabled.

**[steps to reproduce]:**
1. open the browser from the prerequisites.
2. copy and paste the following link in a new tab: 
`about:studies?optin_slug=showing-3rd-sponsored-tile-on-the-newtab-page&optin_branch=treatment&optin_collection=nimbus-preview`
4. open a new tab and make sure there are 3 sponsored tiles.
5. close the browser.
6. open the browser and observe the behavior.

**[expected result]:**
- all the elements from the new tab are displayed: the web search bar, the shortcuts and the recommended by pocket sections.

**[actual result]:**
- only the web search bar remains displayed, the shortcuts and the recommended by pocket sections are gone.

**[additional notes]:**
- the issue is cleared when refreshing the affected tab and is no longer reproducible when opening a new tab.
- both the shortcuts and recommended by pocket sections are enabled in the `about:preferences#home` and “personalize new tab” menu when reproducing the issue.
- the issue is not reproducible with session restore enabled.
- the issue is reproducible only when enrolled in the experiment and it happens across all 3 branches (1,2, and 3 sponsored tiles)
- not sure if related to the issue, but after restarting the browser and reproducing the issue, i noticed the following errors in the browser console:

So, I've been trying to reproduce this weird issue with Firefox Nightly builds on Windows 10, macOS 12.4, and Linux Ubuntu 20.04. To get started, you need to have a VPN client connected to an US server (if you're outside the US), set the `nimbus.debug` pref to `true`, and make sure session restore is disabled.

To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:

1. Open Firefox Nightly from one of those platforms.
2. Create a new tab and paste in this link: `about:studies?optin_slug=showing-3rd-sponsored-tile-on-the-newtab-page&optin_branch=treatment&optin_collection=nimbus-preview`
3. Open another tab and make sure there are three sponsored tiles displayed.
4. Close the browser.
5. Reopen the browser, and that's when things get weird.

Normally, you'd see all these elements on the new tab: the web search bar, shortcuts, and recommended by Pocket sections. But instead, only the web search bar stays, and the other two are gone.

Some interesting notes:

* The issue goes away if I refresh the affected tab.
* Both shortcuts and recommended by Pocket sections are enabled in `about:preferences#home` and ""Personalize New Tab"" menu when reproducing the issue.
* The problem doesn't happen with session restore enabled.
* It only happens when enrolled in the experiment, across all three branches (1, 2, and 3 sponsored tiles).

### steps to reproduce

1. open firefox's app menu > customize homepage > wallpapers menu.
2. tap the independent voices collection's ""learn more"" link.

### expected behavior

tapping ""learn more"" should open a page with more information about the wallpapers.

### actual behavior

tapping ""learn more"" opens https://www.mozilla.org/en-us/stories/joy-of-color but that page no longer exists.

i can't find the ""joy of color"" blog post, so it has presumably been removed. for lack of a better option, we can just point the ""learn more"" link to the desktop-oriented blog post about the ""independent voices"" desktop colorway themes:

https://blog.mozilla.org/products/firefox/firefox-news/independent-voices/

""I was messing around with Firefox's settings and stumbled upon this weird issue.

What I expected to happen was that it would take me to a new page with some info about those wallpapers. But instead, it opened up a URL that no longer exists! It looks like the original blog post has been taken down - I checked The Wayback Machine and it's gone missing sometime between March 19th and April 5th. Since we can't link to something that doesn't exist anymore, maybe we could just redirect the 'learn more' link to a similar blog post about the desktop colorway themes? It seems like the original post was about Firefox's color scheme anyway (https://blog.mozilla.org/products/firefox/firefox-news/independent-voices/). Let me know what you think!"""

So I was trying to clean out my email account and ran into a weird issue. Here's what happened: I had a bunch of unsolicited emails from regular websites, not spam or anything malicious. I wanted to organize them by correspondent, so I sorted the messages list by ""correspondent"" and then grouped them together. When I clicked on one of those groups and hit delete, you'd expect the whole group to disappear from the list - right? Instead, what happened is that the group stayed visible, even though I deleted it! And things got even weirder when I tried to navigate through the list by pressing up or down arrow keys. The cursor would move, but the group that was supposed to be deleted would just magically reappear, and all the other messages would shift up or down one spot. It's like the deletion didn't actually take effect! What should happen is that the deleted group should disappear from the list and the cursor should automatically jump to the next group - but that's not what happens."

 3. go to about:profiles.
 4. click ""create a new profile"".

expected results:
the dialog should have a bright background and dark text, because it's shown within a light firefox window.

actual results:

this happens because the dialog is a document which does not have lwtheme attributes. so the system color colorscheme is picked based on the system appearance, which is dark. however, the dialog background is drawn by the parent window, which uses the light window appearance. so there's a mismatch between the foreground colors used in the dialog document, and the background which comes from the parent window.",good,14,16,87.5,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,True,1,True,1,True,2,False,0,False,0,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,1,"Here's the rewritten bug report:

So I'm continuing on from bug 1704016, where we landed a workaround for the pref-off state.

What I expected to happen is that the dialog would have a bright background and dark text since it's being shown within a light Firefox window. But what actually happens is that the text becomes completely unreadable because it turns out white-on-white.

This all makes sense when you realize that the problem lies with how the dialog is structured as a document without any lwtheme attributes. Since it doesn't have those, the system color colorscheme gets picked based on the system appearance, which is dark in this case. However, the background of the dialog gets drawn by the parent window, which uses the light window appearance. That means there's just a big mismatch between the foreground colors used in the dialog document and the background that comes from the parent window."

if i manually remove the _first_ rule in `rulesets/removeparam/adguard-spyware-url.json`, the navigation stops failing. it is this one particular rule in that one particular ruleset causing the issue, as removing all the other rules in the same ruleset does not resolve the failure.

I'm experiencing an issue with UBlock Origin where navigating to a specific page (`https://example.org/`) causes Firefox to show an error message saying that the page isn't redirecting properly. To reproduce this bug, I downloaded the latest version of UBlock (ubolite_0.1.23.4076.firefox.mv3.xpi) and installed it as a temporary add-on in `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`. Then, I opened the options page and selected the ""optimal"" mode after accepting the permission warning. Next, I scrolled down to the URL tracking protection section on the options page and checked the box next to AdGuard's URL tracking protection feature. After that, I navigated to `https://example.org/` in a new tab, but instead of loading the page properly, Firefox gave me an error message saying that the page isn't redirecting properly. If I manually remove the first rule in the ""rulesets/removeparam/adguard-spyware-url.json"" file, the navigation stops failing, which suggests that this specific rule is causing the issue.

I'm experiencing a weird issue with our web extensions. I've got an attachment that reproduces the problem (repro.zip, attachment 9232943). The crazy thing is that it happens regardless of whether I'm interacting with the panel or not - even if I try to remove it from the console, it just disappears and won't come back until I restart my browser or completely remove the extension. It's like it gets stuck in this weird state where it refuses to reappear. What's trippy is that this happens regardless of whether I've specified certain permissions (like devtools) in the manifest file - it doesn't seem to make a difference. The only thing I've noticed is that it doesn't matter if my extension is running in regular mode or quirks mode; the panel just vanishes and stays gone until I restart.

steps to reproduce:

assign an aria role of 'switch' to a <div>. ensure the element is focusable. create relevant keyup events to toggle the value of 'aria-checked'.


actual results:

the ""off"" state is announced correctly. if you press control+option+space on mac, the aria-checked state changes to 'true', but the voiceover utility does not read the new state.

if you tab away from the element, then tab back, it still reads the state as ""off"".
if you programmatically set the element's aria-checked value to ""true"" initially, it still reads the state as off.
if you use a button or span element, instead of a div, the behavior is the same. i didn't try any other html elements.
if i change the role to 'checkbox', firefox correctly announces checked and unchecked.

the off/on states are announced correctly in chrome and safari on the same system.


expected results:

when the switch was toggled, and the aria-checked value was changed to ""true"", the voiceover utility should have been instructed to announce the ""on"" state of the switch.

Even weirder, if I tabbed away from the element and then back again, it still thought it was in the ""off"" state. I tried programmatically setting the 'aria-checked' value to ""true"" initially, but that didn't work either.

steps to reproduce:

recent update to firefox v.90 (as well as in ff dev. edition v.91) caused an issue to show all check boxes are checked by default in built-in ff pdf viewer.


actual results:

 the pdf doc was generated programmatically on webserver side based on a blank pdf doc with acrofields (template). the result is absolutely all check boxes and radio buttons are checked by default giving a corrupted output, supposedly a built-in pdf.js is changed as well.


expected results:

normally those check boxes should be unmarked (non-checked). such issue never happened in earlier versions of ff. the built-in pdf output is normal in google chrome and ms edge browsers. please see screenshots in attachment.","Based on the provided text, I would rate it as:

I've been experiencing a weird issue since updating to Firefox 90 (and also noticed it in Firefox Dev Edition 91). When I generate a PDF document programmatically on our web server using a blank template with acrofields, all checkboxes and radio buttons are checked by default. This is a total bummer because the output looks corrupted. It's like something changed in the built-in pdf.js that I'm not too happy about. What's weird is that this only happens in Firefox - when I generate the same PDFs in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, they come out fine.

### steps to reproduce

1. enter fenix private mode.
2. log in on a site.
3. change the etp setting from quick settings.
4. close fenix.
5. open fenix and navigate to the site mentioned in step 2.

### expected behavior
the site should treat me as a guest user and quick settings should not be saved from the previous session.

### actual behavior
i am still logged in in the new private session and my previously set etp preference is saved. this is only true for the site from step #2, other sites act as expected.

Hey, I'm reporting a weird issue with Firefox. So, here's what's going on: when I open multiple tabs, mute them, pin those tabs, and then enable high contrast mode, the media indicators for the pinned tabs (you know, the little icons that show up when you hover over them) totally disappear! This only happens when I'm in high contrast mode, so it's like some visual glitch is going on. To reproduce this issue, I followed these steps: opened a few different websites in tabs, muted them, pined those tabs, turned on high contrast mode, and then hovered over the media indicators for the pinned tabs (which are usually visible). But when I did that with high contrast mode on, they just vanished! That's what I expected to happen - no visual issues. But nope, this weird behavior showed up instead.

- macos 11.4
- ubuntu linux 20.04 x64


**[prerequisites]:**
- have a firefox installed.
- have no firefox account signed in.

**[steps to reproduce]:**

1. open the firefox browser with the profile from prerequisites.
2. right click the “toolbar” and select the “customize toolbar…” option.
3. drag and drop the “synced tabs” item on the “toolbar”.
4. click the “done” button located on the bottom right corner of the browser.
5. click the “synced tabs” item and observe the button’s label.

**[expected results]:**
- the “sign in to sync...” label is displayed. 
    
**[actual results]:**
- the button has no label.

**[regression window]:**
- since this issue is not reproducible with the firefox nightly version from 2021-06-05, using the mozregression tool we have managed to find the following regression window:
- last good revision: c4df06014261c1b0ad737c849169fa9db8850679
- first bad revision: 709e714addde7001e05f0b9b6c0df0485b570cf5
pushlog:
- https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/pushloghtml?fromchange=c4df06014261c1b0ad737c849169fa9db8850679&tochange=709e714addde7001e05f0b9b6c0df0485b570cf5

from the pushlog it seems that bug 1698883 has caused this regression.


**[notes]:**
- attached is a screenshot of the issue.
- the issue is also reproducible if a fxa account is logged in without any tabs to sync from other devices.
- the issue is not reproducible in firefox release 90.0.2.

@mike conley, can you please weigh in on this? also, even though the regression is from the ""theme"" component, i have verified that the issue is reproducible on the default themes and on several ""recommended themes"". 

given the above, i think that the ""toolbars and customization"" component is more suitable. feel free to change this accordingly if you think otherwise.","Here's my assessment:

**Best**

The bug report meets all four criteria: S2R, ER, AR, and Additional Information. The report is clear, concise, and well-organized, making it easy to understand the issue and its reproduction steps.",15,16,93.75,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,True,1,True,1,True,2,True,1,True,1,True,2,True,2,True,2,False,0,"Here's a rewritten version of the bug report in a natural, conversational tone:

Hey, I'm reporting an issue with Firefox where the ""Synced Tabs"" button on the toolbar doesn't show its label after customizing it. Here's what happened: I opened Firefox without signing into my account, right-clicked the toolbar and chose ""Customize Toolbar..."", dragged and dropped the ""Synced Tabs"" item onto the toolbar, clicked ""Done"", then clicked the ""Synced Tabs"" button again - but instead of seeing the label that says ""Sign in to Sync..."", there's just a blank button. 

I've tried this on Firefox RC 91.0, Nightly 92.0a1, and even older versions (90.0.2), as well as on Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu Linux - same issue everywhere. I haven't signed into my account yet, so it's not related to that. 

The weird thing is that this issue started appearing after a certain update (709e714addde7001e05f0b9b6c0df0485b570cf5), which was caused by bug 1698883. I've attached a screenshot of the problem for reference. Interestingly, the issue isn't reproducible on older versions or if you're signed into your account - but it does happen when you customize the toolbar and then try to sync tabs without signing in first. 

I'd love to hear what Mike Conley thinks about this, given that the regression is from the ""theme"" component (although I've tested it with default themes and some recommended ones too). In my opinion, since this issue affects the ""toolbars and customization"" component more directly, we might want to move it there. What do you think?"

To reproduce this bug, you can follow these steps: open Firefox Nightly with my prerequisites in place, copy and paste the link `about:studies?optin_slug=showing-3rd-sponsored-tile-on-the-newtab-page&optin_branch=treatment&optin_collection=nimbus-preview` into a new tab, then open another new tab, click inside the address bar, and take a look at the top sites list. What I expect to see is just my default top sites showing up, but what actually happens is that the link from the third sponsored tile takes center stage. I've attached a screenshot of the issue - let me know if you need any further info!"

I'm reporting a weird bug that I encountered with Firefox Nightly build 107.0a1 (specifically, the one from September 27th, 2022). It affects multiple platforms - macOS 12.5.1, Windows 10 x64, and Ubuntu 20.04 x64.

To reproduce the issue, you need to have the latest Firefox Nightly build installed and opened, with some specific preferences enabled. First, focus the browser console (Ctrl + Shift + J), paste a certain syntax from my prerequisites into it, press Enter, skip a few steps until you get to the ""Colorways"" modal, hover over the default icon theme, and observe the tooltip text.

What I expect to see is the text ""Current Nightly Colors"", but instead, I got ""[object object]"". It's like nothing is showing up!

1. in firefox nightly 92, open https://mozilla.cultureamp.com/app/skills-coach/activity/24a1eee41aabfbb870f72f2158667007247b949c55ff00cf04763e31107927179d361efbef9564132177d6004a8122cf
2. click the ""next"" button four times to reach the ""get some practice naming the need"" screen.

### expected result

the video should have a play button, like in firefox 90 and 91.

### actual result

the video is blurry and has no play button. see the attached screenshot.

i see the following error about unmasked_renderer_webgl in the web console:

```

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:88.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/88.0

steps to reproduce:

right-click on a tab to open the context menu in swedish localized firefox 88.0 (64-bit).


actual results:

the ""undo closed tab"" option has been renamed ""öppna stängd flik igen"" and uses 's' as the access key, which is the same as for the ""close tab"" option named ""stäng flik"".


expected results:

the two menu items should not have the same access key.

personal opinion: i much prefer the previous translation ""ångra stäng flik"". i would also accept ""ångra flikstängning"", as it is more correct swedish.

note: in the screenshot provided i've used userchrome.css to remove the options to close multiple tabs and rearranged the positions of the ""close tab"" and ""undo close tab"" options back to how they were in previous versions.","Here's my assessment:

However, what is weird is that it uses the same access key ('s') as the 'Close Tab' option (""stäng flik""). That's not ideal, since now I can accidentally close a tab thinking I'm undoing it. My expectation was that these two menu items would have different access keys to avoid confusion. Personally, I liked the old translation ""ångra stäng flik"" better - and honestly, ""ångra flikstängning"" is even more accurate Swedish if you ask me!

steps to reproduce:

close firefox and re-open it at intervals through the day.  eventually you will hit a time when it opens, but then if you click on a useful page (like yahoo mail, or perform a search with google) it hangs for 5 to 30 minutes.


actual results:

during this time firefox is unresponsive.  if you close and reopen, same thing happens.  this condition will persist until you simply leave it running, walk away, and come back in half an hour and it'll be fine.  this happens on 3 desktops and a laptop, all running updated versions of windows 10.  it has been happening for a year and getting gradually worse.  i have stopped all background tasks i can find.  i cannot stop windows security scans.  that may be an issue.  during this time other apps will be sluggish, but will work.  microsoft edge will sometimes lock up for a few seconds, but nothing like firefox.  after a year, i have reluctantly used edge more and more because it heavily impacts my productivity.  since this happens in different locations with completely different internet providers (xfinity, sudden link) it doesn't seem provider related.  it happens every day.  usually about the same time.  but the time gradually changes.  for a while it happened about 2:30 pm.  if i use firefox anytime after that it goes through this hang.  somewhat better if i have not cut my computer off, but still does it.  


expected results:

if windows reports it is up and running, firefox should work without imposing 5-30 minute delay.

""So, I've been having this super frustrating issue with Firefox for over a year now, and it's getting worse. What happens is that if I close Firefox and reopen it throughout the day, eventually it'll start working again - but only until I try to do something useful like check my email or search Google. Then, it just hangs for 5-30 minutes! It doesn't matter what time of day it is, as long as I've opened and closed Firefox multiple times. I've tried closing all background tasks I could find, but nothing seems to make a difference. It's not just me either - this has happened on three desktops and a laptop, all running updated versions of Windows 10. The weirdest part is that other apps seem to work fine, even Microsoft Edge which can get slow occasionally. What's really getting in the way is how often this happens at roughly the same time every day (it used to be around 2:30 pm, but it's been creeping up). If I use Firefox after that, it'll just hang again - and if I don't shut down my computer entirely, it'll still happen. It's super frustrating because it makes me want to switch to Edge permanently!

The only thing missing is the ""Expected Result (ER)"" section which is typically part of a standard bug report format.

I'm reporting an issue with Firefox where the zoom icons (- and +) disappear when you hover over them inside iframes. This happens across multiple platforms, including Windows 10, macOS 10.15, and Ubuntu 20.04, and affects Firefox versions 91.0 (both ESR and regular), as well as version 92.0a1. To reproduce the bug, just follow these steps: launch Firefox, download and open this test file [embedded test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ynitiwtzm131c36igusszq5bjhyovff7/view), and then hover over the zoom icons in each iframe. What you should see is that they're always visible, but what actually happens is that they vanish when you hover over them. I've attached a video (pdf hover zoom.webm) that shows the issue in action - it's pretty straightforward to see what's going on."

""So I was messing around with Firefox and noticed this weird thing - when you zoom in on the about:preferences or about:addons pages, and then click inside the top search bar, the blue focus line that usually fills in to help you navigate doesn't quite work right. Specifically, it's like the edges of the line just disappear instead of staying filled in as expected.

I've attached a screenshot from March 30 at 10:52 AM to show what's going on - just zoom in for better visibility! It seems like this issue is present even when Proton preferences are turned on or off, which makes me think it might not be unique to one particular setup. If other pages that use the same search bar experience this too, that'd be worth looking into as well."""

**[affected versions]:**
- firefox beta 89.0b13 - build id: 20210516190025
- firefox nightly 90.0a1 - build id: 20210516091748

**[affected platforms]:**
- windows 10 x64
- windows 8.1 x64
- macos 10.15.7
- linux mint 20 x64

**[prerequisites]:**
- have a new firefox profile.

**[steps to reproduce]:**
1. open the browser with the profile from the prerequisites.
2. double click the ""now now"" secondary button.
3. observe the behavior.

**[expected result]:**
- the second screen of the ""about:welcome"" page is displayed.
 
**[actual result]:**
- the third screen of the ""about:welcome"" page is displayed instead.

**[regression window]:**
- since this issue is not reproducible with the firefox nightly build from 2021/05/17, using the mozregression tool i have managed to find the following regression window:
last good revision: 25854de1a92c7fec1fcf01f271189cce5008bd74

from the pushlog it seems that bug 1698204 has caused this behavior.

**[additional notes]:**
- if a triple-click action is performed on the ""now now"" secondary button from the first screen of the ""about:welcome"" page, the background image remains displayed and the user is not redirected to the ""about:newtab"" page.
- this issue is reproducible on the first and the second screen of the new users onboarding.

I'm experiencing some weird behavior with Firefox, specifically when trying to pin it to my Windows taskbar. It happened across three different versions of Firefox - nightly 88.0a1, beta 87.0b7, and release 86.0. I've tried it on two different Windows 10 versions, both x64.

To reproduce the issue, I need to create a new Firefox profile, save this specific [user.js](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ytsdc0vw1ftxrs0yaeh6ruozccnpq5ed/view?usp=sharing) file in the profile folder, then start Firefox with the ""--first-startup"" argument. Next, I click the ""pin to taskbar"" button, followed by the back browser button, and then click ""pin to taskbar"" again while observing my Windows taskbar.

What's supposed to happen is that the Firefox icon should be correctly displayed on my taskbar after pinning it. But instead, it gets replaced with a placeholder icon. This issue might affect users who are enrolled in future experiments based on this feature, so it's worth looking into. A quick fix is to unpin and then re-pin Firefox to get the correct icon back."

**[notes]:**
- this issue is also reproducible when trying to close the browser from taskbar:
1. by clicking the “close window” option from the firefox icon right-click menu
2. by clicking the “close” button when the firefox icon is hovered and the browser window is previewed.
- this issue is also reproducible for the existing/updating users ""onboarding"" modal. however, it seems that the “alt+f4” scenario is fixed for the “onboarding” modal (see bug 1705334) but it’s still reproducible for quick suggest modal. here are the other scenarios that are tracked for the “onboarding” modal: bug 1706652 and bug 1706963.

**[affected versions]:**
- firefox nightly 90.0a1 (build id: 20210513214800);
- firefox beta 89.0b12 (build id: 20210513185752);

**[affected platforms]:**
- windows 10 x64;
- macos 10.15.7;
- linux mint 20 x64;

**[prerequisites]:**
- have the latest firefox nightly installed.
- have the following prefs set: 
- `browser.urlbar.quicksuggest.enabled` to `true`.
- `browser.urlbar.quicksuggest.seenrestarts` to '89'.
- `browser.urlbar.quicksuggest.showedonboardingdialog` to `false`.

**[steps to reproduce]:**
1. open the firefox browser with the profile from prerequisites.
2. restart the browser 3 times so that the quick suggest modal is displayed at the 3rd session startup.
3. press the alt+f4 (cmd+q) keyboard shortcut.
4. observe what happens next.

**[expected result]:**
- the quick suggest modal is dismissed and the ""close tabs and exit?"" dialog is displayed instead.

""I'm reporting an issue where the 'Close browser with modal shown' GIF attachment shows what happens when I try to close Firefox while the quick suggest modal is still up. This happens not just when I use the normal way to close the browser by clicking the X button, but also when I right-click the Firefox icon in the taskbar and select ""Close window"", or even when I hover over the icon and click the previewed window's close button.

I've tried reproducing this issue on different versions of Firefox (nightly 90.0a1 and beta 89.0b12) on multiple platforms (Windows 10 x64, macOS 10.15.7, and Linux Mint 20 x64). To reproduce the issue, I need to have the latest Firefox nightly installed, with some specific preferences set: `browser.urlbar.quicksuggest.enabled` must be `true`, `browser.urlbar.quicksuggest.seenrestarts` must be '89', and `browser.urlbar.quicksuggest.showedonboardingdialog` must be `false`.

Here's how to reproduce the issue: first, open Firefox with a profile that has those specific preferences. Then, restart the browser three times so that the quick suggest modal pops up at the third session startup. Next, press the Alt+F4 (or Cmd+Q on a Mac) keyboard shortcut. Finally, observe what happens next - and it's not what I expected!

What should happen is that the quick suggest modal gets dismissed and the ""Close tabs and exit?"" dialog appears instead. But in reality, the quick suggest modal stays stuck on screen and the ""Close tabs and exit?"" dialog just queues up without being displayed.

Hey, I'm trying to report a weird issue with Thunderbird (version 91.0.3) and Firefox (version 91.0). To reproduce it, I'm using this Sieve extension (https://github.com/thsmi/sieve), but basically you can trigger it on any extension that has the ""tabs"" permission.

This only happens when I'm on the calendar tab - if I try it from another tab like my inbox, everything works as expected.

It's weird because, when I put a breakpoint in one of the files (chrome://messenger/content/parent/ext-tabs-base.js), I can see that the `tabwrapper.browser` is defined and working just fine for the inbox tab.

nightly 88 - bug.png

**affected versions:**
all latest firefox versions

**tested on:**
macos

**steps to reproduce:**
1. enable the macos screen reader before starting firefox 
2. go to https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html
3. use option+command+right arrow to navigate along with the screen reader to the microphone&camera button
4. follow the voiceover guidance to pres the button (option+command+space) or hit enter

**expected result:**
as soon as the permission prompt is displayed, the voice-over should start reading out loud all the content from the prompt (such as with nvda on windows)

**actual results:**
2 possible behaviors, inconsistent :
- only the question is detected by the screen reader: ""allow mozilla.github.io to use your camera and microphone?""
- everything is detected correctly: question, camera label, microphone menulist, etc

**note:**
after refreshing the page and following again the steps the screen reader will not detect the toggled permission prompt at all, see attached screenshot. 

**regression-range:**
reproducible on fx 86, also intermittently. there are 2 bugs here (from which 1 is intermittent) and the refresh page aspect mentioned in *notes* is also causing troubles narrowing the regression-range. not related to proton changes.

**severity:**
marking this as s2 given a11y is an important area to cover and at this point the webrtc prompt might not be functional for screen reader users. please feel free to change the severity if need be after further investigations, i assume people who use screen readers on a daily basis will have a more technical and in-depth analysis of the severity for this issue.","I'd rate this bug report as ""good"". Here's why:

1. Steps to Reproduce (S2R): **Present**: The steps to reproduce the issue are clear, concise, and well-documented.
2. Expected Result (ER): **Present**: The expected result is clearly stated, allowing the developer to understand what should happen.
3. Actual Result (AR): **Present**: The actual results are described in detail, including the inconsistent behavior.
4. Additional Information: **Partially Present**: While there isn't specific information on software version, build number, or environment, the report does provide relevant details about the affected versions and tested platforms.

The only thing missing is a description of the regression range, which would be beneficial for developers to track down the issue. However, this doesn't detract from the overall quality of the report.",16,16,100.0,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,True,1,True,1,True,2,True,1,True,1,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,1,"Here's the rewritten bug report:

Hey there, I wanted to report an issue with Firefox's accessibility features on macOS. When using the built-in screen reader before starting up Firefox, I've noticed two inconsistent behaviors while trying to navigate a certain webpage (https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html). First, when I follow the voice guidance to press the microphone&camera button, the screen reader will only read out loud the question that pops up asking for permission (""allow mozilla.github.io to use your camera and microphone?""). But sometimes, it'll correctly detect all the content in the prompt, including the camera label and microphone menu list. The problem is that this behavior is inconsistent - there's no telling which one I'll get! To make things even more confusing, if I refresh the page and try again, the screen reader will completely stop detecting the permission prompt altogether (see attached screenshot). This issue affects all the latest versions of Firefox on my Mac, and I've noticed it happening even in older versions like 86. It's a pretty big deal because this means that users who rely on screen readers might not be able to access certain features properly."

""So, I've been noticing some weirdness with tooltips in Firefox - specifically when I'm using the dark theme and connected to an external monitor (in my case, it's a 1080 LG display). What happens is that instead of showing up as they normally do, the tooltips get all bolded and blurry on the external screen. It looks like this: [attachment 9235773 - macos_tooltip.png]. I can reproduce the issue on macOS 10.13, but not on 10.14 or 10.15 (even though everything else is the same). Interestingly, when I'm just using my native MacBook monitor, the tooltips are still bolded, but at least they're not blurry!

Hey, so I'm experiencing a weird issue with my laptop. I was using Firefox 94.0 (on Ubuntu) when I decided to put my laptop to sleep and then wake it back up again. But after doing that, I noticed that all the fonts on my screen were suddenly garbled and none of the icons were visible - it's like the whole thing got corrupted! Even when I opened new tabs, the text was all jumbled up. I took a screenshot (see attachment 9241704) to show you what it looks like. What's weird is that this only started happening after I switched to using the EGL mode in my Nightly builds. I tried going back to an earlier version and still got the same problem, so I think it might be related to that change. I'm running NVIDIA proprietary drivers if that makes any difference. Anyway, what I'm expecting is that putting my laptop to sleep and then waking it up again shouldn't break my browsing experience - but right now, it seems like a simple suspend/resume cycle can mess everything up!"

## steps to reproduce
1. add searchbar to the right of urlbar. remove any flexible spaces on the right of searchbar.
2. (optional) add more search engines. 
3. shrink searchbar.

## actual result
searchbar cannot shrink as much as pre-bug 1794630. please refer to the attached screenshot.

## expected result
i don't know if this is the intended new behaviour. the new minimum width changes too much.

i can shrink searchbar some more by adding flexible spaces to the right but it leaves a gap in the toolbar. searchbar widens again when i remove the flexible spaces.

If I want to get the search bar to shrink even more, I can add some flexible spaces on the right side, but then I'm left with a gap in the toolbar (which isn't ideal). And if I remove those flexible spaces again, the search bar just goes back to its original size.

steps to reproduce:

i created a small test case to show that scroll events stop working if a synchronous xhr request is startet while scrolling an iframe.

in the test case there is a scroll listener that logs the current y scroll position, each time you scroll. also there is a simple xhr request, started after 5s timeout.
if you keep on scrolling while the request is started you can see that the listener stops to log the y position. there is also no error on the console. 
if you do not scroll while the the request is started (only before and after), everything works as expected.
see video and test case package. this behavior/bug was introduced with firefox 66.

steps:
- open https://codesandbox.io/s/hardcore-lamport-1l11b or attached zip file (local webserver)
- open native firefox dev tools / console
- keep scrolling
-- you will see logs of your scroll position until the request after 5s is started

""I've got this weird issue I'd love to get fixed! So, I created a test case (which you can find attached as a zip file or on Codesandbox) that shows what happens when you're scrolling inside an iframe and a synchronous XHR request kicks off. What's supposed to happen is that the scroll event listener keeps logging the current y-position while you keep scrolling. But here's the thing: if you start scrolling after the 5-second timeout for the XHR request, the listener just stops working altogether - no errors in the console either! It's only when you stop scrolling during the request (or before/after it) that everything behaves normally. This weird behavior started happening around Firefox 66. To reproduce this issue:

- Open either the Codesandbox link or my attached zip file on a local webserver
- Fire up the native Firefox dev tools and open the console
- Keep scrolling while observing the console logs

You'll see that the scroll position keeps being logged until the XHR request kicks in. And then, poof! The events just stop working.

What I expect to happen is that the scroll events should keep working no matter what's going on with the XHR requests - but sadly, that's not the case right now."""

Hey, I'm reporting a weird issue that happens in Firefox. So, whenever I open the bookmarks toolbar sub-menu and then try to add a new bookmark or folder, it just doesn't work - nothing happens when I click on the ""Add Folder"" option! This is happening across multiple platforms: Windows 10 x64, macOS 10.12.6, and Ubuntu 20. It's also affecting Firefox versions 92.0a1 and 91.0b9. To reproduce this issue, all you need to do is: launch Firefox, right-click on a new tab in the bookmarks toolbar, open the sub-menu (Always Show/Never Show/Only Show on New Tab), and then try clicking ""Add Folder"". What I expect to happen is that all the bookmarks toolbar options should still work after opening the sub-menu.

steps to reproduce:

- i noticed this on windows 10, nightly 90.0a1, build 20210525093431, with proton settings enabled. i went ahead and made a brand new, empty profile with the profile manager to test it. the bug is always present, seems to just be an oversight

str:
- click & hold on the new tab button
- opens a context menu, `.new-tab-popup`
- click ""no container"", it opens a new tab with context id 0
- now right click the new tab button
- opens a similar context menu, `#new-tab-button-popup`
- click ""no container""


actual results:

- it does nothing
- looking at the dom, the menus look identical. in both cases the menuitems for the actual containers have `command` attributes that invoke [opennewusercontexttab](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#4857), which gets the context id from an attribute on the click event target, the menuitem.
- but in both popups, the ""no container"" menuitem has no command attribute, nor does it have any other event listeners.


expected results:

so why the different behavior — i think this is because the click & hold popup is a child of the new tab button, whereas the right-click popup is off on its own in `#mainpopupset`.

so when you click the ""no container"" item in the click & hold popup, the event is bubbling up to the new tab button, which has event listeners like `command=""cmd_newnavigatortab""` and `oncommand=""browseropentab(event);""`.

when you click the same item in the right-click popup, nothing opens because there isn't any command event listener targeting it or its parent.

you can see that adding `command=""cmd_newnavigatortab""` or `command=""browser:newusercontexttab""` to the ""no container"" item in the right-click menu fixes the issue. the command attribute can also just be added to the right-click menupopup itself.

so i'm pretty sure the issue is purely that there aren't any event listeners for the ""no container"" items, and i guess this was just overlooked because it's accidentally working correctly in the click & hold menu, due to the event bubbling up to an element that just so happens to have an almost identical purpose/behavior.

so i think my suggestion is to add the command attribute to the menuitem [when it's being created](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/utilityoverlay.js#780).","Based on the text, I would rate it as:

3672,"steps to reproduce (on a platform where detecting window occlusion is supported, i think that's mac and windows) :
- load a page with a css animation that can run on the compositor, eg. `data:text/html,<head><style>body{animation: fadein 1s infinite;} @keyframes fadein{from{opacity: 0;}}</style><body>text`
- cover the window entirely with another window.
- see that the cpu usage barely drops (i checked that using about:processes in another window).

when the same tab with css animation is put in the background by opening another tab in the same window, the cpu use drops significantly.

after doing some debugging, i noticed that removing the nsiremotetab.preservelayers call at https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c7183440fe8ad391e2ab2e990229dd85fac318d3/browser/base/content/tabbrowser.js#5636-5639 makes the animations stop when the window is occluded.

when the window is occluded, the refresh driver ticks are throttled in the content process, only the compositor/renderer threads remain active at 60hz.

example profile where i made the animated tab inactive first by occluding the window (the ipcs related to sending vsync notifications to the child process stop, but the renderer and compositor activity continues) and another time by switching to an about:blank tab (this time the compositor and renderer thread activity stopped): https://share.firefox.dev/3kvggiy

This only happens if you create the list formatting after typing the text - if you enable the list formatting first and then add your text, it displays correctly. I was able to reproduce this issue on my Mac running macOS 12, as well as on Ubuntu 22 and Windows 10, so it's not just a one-off thing. It doesn't happen in Chrome, by the way. The affected versions are Nightly 110.0a1, Firefox 109.0b9, and Firefox 108.0.2. I've attached a screen recording that shows exactly what's going on if you want to take a look. Let me know if you need any more info!"""

steps to reproduce:

### microsec incident report - misissuance of 1 ov certificate with key usage keyencipherment

---

> i -- how your ca first became aware of the problem (e.g. via a problem report submitted to your problem reporting mechanism, a discussion in mozilla.dev.security.policy, a bugzilla bug, or internal self-audit), and the time and date.

microsec received an email based incident report to info@e-szigno.hu at tuesday, august 31, 2021 9:36 am

---

> ii -- a timeline of the actions your ca took in response. a timeline is a date-and-time-stamped sequence of all relevant events. this may include events before the incident was reported, such as when a particular requirement became applicable, or a document changed, or a bug was introduced, or an audit was done.

###### 2021-08-31 07:36 utc

- receive a notification email about the incorrectly issued tls certificate

###### 2021-08-31 08:27 utc

- microsec customer service officer processed the incoming email and opened an internal bug

###### 2021-08-31 08:42 utc

- initiating an investigation to identify the cause(s) of the error and to prevent further similar errors

###### 2021-08-31 09:54 utc

- contacting the site owner and informing them about the planned revocation

###### 2021-08-31 10:12 utc

- revocation of the incorrect certificate

---

> iii -- whether your ca has stopped, or has not yet stopped, issuing certificates with the problem. a statement that you have will be considered a pledge to the community; a statement that you have not requires an explanation.


the quick investigation confirmed that the current policy documents and certificate profiles are ok and that there is no need to suspend the certificate issuance.

---

> iv -- a summary of the problematic certificates. for each problem: number of certs, and the date the first and last certs with that problem were issued.

###### 2020-03-09

- one ov certificate with ecc key was issued with an incorrent key usage bit setting

---

> v -- the complete certificate data for the problematic certificates. the recommended way to provide this is to ensure each certificate is logged to ct and then list the fingerprints or crt.sh ids, either in the report or as an attached spreadsheet, with one list per distinct problem.

| v2x-pki.com | https://crt.sh/?id=2730469679 |

---

> vi -- explanation about how and why the mistakes were made or bugs introduced, and how they avoided detection until now.

#### we performed the initial investigation and we found the following

###### 2018-04-21
- microsec installed an automatic check in the ca software which limits the usability of the different certificate profiles according to the type of the public key in the enduser certificate. the operation is based on a configuration file, which lists the allowed certificate profiles for a given key type in a given ica.

###### 2020-03-05
- version 2.13 of our public policies was released. this included the correct requirement for ku bits in case of ecc key.
- certificate profiles were updated according to the cp change to use version 2.13 cp oid values. certificate profiles included the appropriate ku setting for ecc based certificates.

###### 2020-03-09
- the ov certificate was issued under our rsa based ica ""e-szigno ssl ca 2014"", but for an ecc end-entity key.  microsec does not usually mix different key types, it was an exception event that we have issued a certificate for en ecc key from an rsa based ca hierarchy.
- the ro officer issued the certificate using the default rsa certificate profile
- the ca allowed the issuance of the certificate for the ecc key with an rsa certificate profile due to a configuration problem
- the certificate became faulty because an improper certificate profile was used for issuance, which resulted the incorrect ku setting
- the manual immediate post issuance quality control check did not recognize the fault


###### 2021-01-07
- microsec introduced the automatic cablint and zlint checks for each tls certificates which replaced the former manual checks.

###### 2020-2021
- microsec developed its certificate policy management system in two steps during 2020 and 2021. it results higher accountability and minimize the risk of misissuance.


#### summary of the findings

the misissuance was caused by a configuration problem in the certificate profile management system 
- ro officer selected the standard rsa based certificate profile for the ecc key in the rsa based ca (it is not her/his task to check the key type)
- the rsa based certificate profile was allowed for ecc keys in the rsa based ca due to a configuration problem (configuration fault)
- the certificate was issued with improper ku bits
- the manual immediate post issuance quality control check did not identify the problem
- the following quarterly quality control check did not select this specific certificate to re-check in april 2020

---

> vii -- list of steps your ca is taking to resolve the situation and ensure such issuance will not be repeated in the future, accompanied with a timeline of when your ca expects to accomplish these things.

#### immediate actions

- microsec revoked the affected ov tls certificate within 3 hours.
- microsec has verified all active certificate profiles, they were ok at the time of misissuance, and they are still ok.
- microsec has verified all active policy documents, they were ok at the time of misissuance and they are still ok.
- a quick initial investigation was made to find out the reason of the misissuance.
- microsec identified the causes of the misissuance as you see it above.
- microsec has verified the configuration of the certificate profiles in the ca software, it is ok.
- microsec checked all the valid certificates for this type of problem, there is no more certificate with this problem.
- microsec opened an incident bug in mozilla's bugzilla with the present report.


#### further planned actions

##### deadline: 2021-09-15

- microsec will check wether the present controls are sufficient to prevent a misissuance with this problem again.
- microsec will keep a training for the ro operators how to use the proper certificate profiles according to the type of the enduser key.

""So, it looks like we had an issue where one of our certificates was misissued with the wrong key usage bits. It happened on August 31st, and we got notified through an email report to our incident reporting system. We started investigating right away and found that there was no need to suspend certificate issuance while we sorted things out. The problematic certificate was issued back in 2020, so it's been a while. Apparently, the issue was caused by a configuration problem with our certificate profile management system. One of our RO officers accidentally selected the wrong template for an ECC key, and since our systems allowed RSA-based templates to be used for ECC keys at the time, the mistake went undetected until now. We've already revoked the affected certificate and are planning some further actions to make sure this doesn't happen again. By September 15th, we'll have a new training in place for our RO operators to ensure they're using the right templates for the job."""

""I'm reporting an issue I encountered with Firefox 92.0a1 (July 28th) on my Windows 10 machine. When you launch the browser and access any webpage, click on the 'About Website' button, then toggle the ETP button - you should see a color scheme that makes all elements visible, right? But what actually happens is that the thumb on the light-blue toggle bar turns white, making it really hard to see. It's pretty poor visibility-wise.

I think there are some simple ways to improve this. You could change the background of the toggle bar to another shade of blue that would make the thumb stand out more. Alternatively, you could make the background white and use a more visible color for the thumb itself. Or, you know, just add a border around the thumb ring in another color to separate everything better.

I'm not sure when this started happening or if it's related to any other changes - I'll leave that to the QA team to investigate (they're the experts, after all!). As far as I know, it happened after the Proton overhaul. Attached is a screenshot of what I see, in case you want a visual."""

steps to reproduce:

i have enabled the new feature ""browser.download.improvements_to_download_panel"" in about:config. 

while this has mostly been an improvement in quality of life, it seems to be ignoring the appropriate download folder setting.

i have my download directory mapped to a large external storage drive to avoid large downloads cluttering up my ssd.

however, i am needing to download a number of large tar.gz files and they're not going to the drive, but instead to my ~/downloads folder.


actual results:

with the feature on, files ignore the configured download location setting and default to ~/downloads, rather than the download folder i have specified.

i will add that i suspect that this may be file-type specific. most files - if i have downloaded them previously - behave correctly. however, if firefox doesn't list them in the ""what to do with downloads"" action list, or it is set to ask for that file, it ignores the download folder setting. i saw this temporarily when i was checking if this solves my earlier issue regarding pdf handling (mostly, but not quite)*.

i will also add that the files apparently have read-only permissions to me and _no_ permissions to group or others, which is unusual and may be related. this refers to the linux file permissions and not to how the file is formatted or any settings of its own that it may have.

So I've got this weird issue with Firefox where it just won't import logins from a CSV file like it should. It happens on multiple platforms - my Mac, Windows 10, and Ubuntu 20.04 - and across different versions of Firefox Nightly (105.0a1) and Beta (104.0b1). 

To reproduce the issue, you'll need to create a new Firefox profile, grab a CSV file with some logins in it, and make sure the ""signon.management.page.fileimport.enabled"" preference is turned on. Then, follow these steps: open Firefox with that profile, head to the ""about:logins"" page, click the menu button, select ""Import from a file..."", pick your CSV file, and see what happens next.

The expected result should be that the logins get imported and you see the import modal pop up. But instead, nothing happens - no imports, no modal. I've done some digging using Mozregression tools to try and figure out when this issue started, and it looks like the problem showed up in Firefox Nightly build 104.0a1 (build id: 20220725154459) onwards.

I'm not sure which bug is causing this, so I'd love it if someone could take a look at the regression window I've provided - that's [link](https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/pushloghtml?fromchange=f33bef1f7d560e494bab0599e2022a3ea53902f9&tochange=c39b51a0b211e7bd45cb78f14eda63698d60dc1b).

Some extra notes: when I try to import the file, I get an error in the browser console that says ""Error: telemetrystopwatch: key ""pwmgr_import_logins_from_file_ms"" was already initialized"". And it's not just CSV files - I've tried importing other types of files too, and nothing works. I've attached a screen recording of the issue and a screenshot with the browser console error if you want to take a closer look."

steps to reproduce:

repro with https://jsfiddle.net/tdp0z98q/. this issue affects macos accent input on google docs.

1. open the fiddle in firefox on a mac. (the fiddle just sets up a contenteditable div, cancels beforeinput events, and resets the selection on keypress).
2. place the cursor between the two characters in the content editable.
3. type a character.
    * notice that no character is inserted, because we call preventdefault on beforeinput.
4. long press on a vowel until the accent menu pops up, then click on one of the options.
    * notice that the selected option replaces the previous character, event though we called preventdefault on beforeinput.
5. continue inserting accented characters.
    * notice that the position where the character is replaced continuously alternates between before the caret and after the caret.


actual results:

* the accented character is inserted despite preventdefault called on the beforeinput event. (i haven't found any event i could block to prevent this from happening).
* the accent menu alternates between replacing the character before the caret and after the caret.

expected results:

the cssrules should have been updated by the new content. at the above jsfiddle, the first two lines should show different css, and the last line should show the latest css. the example shows that the method replacesync () works, but that even removing all the rules from the stylesheet does not allow replace () to function (see screenshot).

I'm reporting a weird issue I ran into with Firefox. When I try to update a CSS stylesheet using the `replace` method, something's not quite right. Here's what happens: if I create a new style sheet and add some content using `stylesheet.replace`, it seems like nothing changes - the CSS rules stay the same. Even when I use a `.then` promise to replace the content with new content, it doesn't update the stylesheet.

To reproduce this issue, I do the following:

1. Create a brand new style sheet using the ""New Stylesheet"" option.
2. Add some content using `stylesheet.replace`.
3. Use a `.then` promise to replace the content with new content when the promise is returned.

A working example of this can be found at https://jsfiddle.net/skepticalee/bvwqk9a5/92/. As you can see, even though the `replaceSync()` method works just fine, the `replace()` method doesn't seem to do its job. In fact, removing all the rules from the stylesheet doesn't help either - it still doesn't update.

steps to reproduce:

- open a context menu that has disabled menuitems. i.e. right click on a video player on youtube
- use arrow keys to advance/rewind ""focus""


actual results:

- disabled menuitems can still gain `_moz-menuactive` attribute, even though there is no visual feedback to show that they are focused or hovered
- that is, the css rules that style the active menuitems explicitly say `:not([disabled=""true""])`, or they have some overriding rule like `[_moz-menuactive=""true""][disabled=""true""] {color: graytext;  background-color: unset;}`, so you can't tell whether a disabled button is ""active"" (in this case meaning keyboard-focused or cursor-hovered)
- from a sighted user's point of view, it looks like you're advancing down the list, then all of a sudden the cursor showing the selected menu/menuitem just abruptly disappears, before reappearing when you navigate to the next non-disabled element in the list.


expected results:

- those rules are clearly intended to prevent visual feedback that would mislead a sighted user into thinking the element is an active affordance.
- but the functions that advance through menuitems do not abide by the same philosophy. this could mislead a blind or visually impaired user depending on their screen reader settings, but presumably it's also visually confusing and annoying for sighted users, (at least for me) since an element that can't be activated or interacted with in any way is being pseudo-focused, so it's consuming keyboard inputs. and meanwhile, there's no visual indication that it's holding focus except for the absence of highlighting on any other menuitems in the list.
- there's a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14841) from 2 decades ago making the opposite argument. i know there are differing opinions on this, since the existence of the disabled button should still be apparent to screen readers. but there are ways to make disabled buttons visible to screen readers and still let the keyboard navigation walker skip them. look at the customizable toolbar buttons for example.
- looking at the most modern parts of firefox, i can't find any examples of focus behaving like the context menus do. but i can find a ton of counterexamples, like [browser-toolbarkeynav.js](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser-toolbarkeynav.js#65), [panelmultiview.jsm](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/customizableui/panelmultiview.jsm#1594), even [the basic button element](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/content/widgets/button.js#189).
- also, making disabled buttons known to screen readers is not the be-all, end-all, since the buttons do not provide any information as to why they are disabled. even with vision, the most a user can glean from their existence is the fact that they could conceivably provide the named functionality in some other, unknown circumstance.
- i still think that's valuable information so i wouldn't want them hidden, either visually or to screen readers, but i think the priority of visibility should be lower than that of avoiding the confusion caused by permitting disabled elements to be focused, especially when there's no visual feedback. ideally, they should be read by screen readers but not focusable at all, just like toolbar buttons with open popups. to that end, context menus could use the same kind of node filter setup that the javascript key navigation modules use.","""good""

""I'm running into an issue where disabled menu items in Firefox can still gain focus even when they shouldn't be able to. For example, if I right-click on a video player on YouTube and use the arrow keys to navigate through the context menu, I'll eventually land on a disabled item that looks like it's highlighted or selected - but it's not actually functional. This is because the CSS rules that style active menu items don't take into account whether an element is disabled or not.

From my perspective as a sighted user, this can be pretty confusing because it makes it seem like I'm suddenly skipping over elements in the list without realizing what's happening. But for users who rely on screen readers, this could be even more problematic because they might not realize that the focus has jumped to a disabled element.

I think this is an issue because it goes against the philosophy of preventing visual feedback that would mislead sighted users into thinking an element is active when it's actually not. Instead, we're getting this weird situation where an element can't be interacted with in any way - but it's still consuming keyboard inputs and pretending to be focused.

There's a similar bug from way back in 2004 that makes the opposite argument, saying that disabled elements should always be accessible to screen readers. But I think there are ways to make disabled buttons visible to screen readers without allowing them to gain focus. For example, we could use node filters like those used in JavaScript key navigation modules.

Ultimately, my goal is to prevent this kind of confusion and ensure that users - sighted or not - can navigate menus and context menus without getting stuck on disabled elements."""

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (macintosh; intel mac os x 10.15; rv:107.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/107.0

steps to reproduce:

0. ensure to have `gfx.canvas.accelerated` flag set on.
1. set a canvas 2d context current transform to a rotated matrix.
2. stroke a rectangle on that context.


actual results:

the rectangle is stroked without antialiasing.


expected results:

the rectangle should have been drawn with antialiasing.

this happens only with *true* rectangles. adding anything else to the subpath, even a single `moveto` call, will make it render as expected.  
it also doesn't affect rectangles transformed through `path2d.addpath(path, matrix)`.  
i noticed this by seeing 4 new failures in https://wpt.fyi/results/result/css/geometry/dommatrix2dinit-validate-fixup.html since hardware acceleration defaults to true on macos (bug 1773712).","""good""",14,16,87.5,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,False,0,False,0,True,2,False,0,True,1,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,2,"Here's the rewritten bug report:

When I set the `gfx.canvas.accelerated` flag and then stroke a rectangle with a rotated matrix using the 2D canvas context, it shows up without any antialiasing - which is not what I expected. To reproduce this, you need to make sure that flag is enabled, create a 2D canvas context and set its transform to a rotated matrix, and then just draw a simple rectangle on it. The weird thing is that this only happens with pure rectangles; if you add any other subpath or move the cursor even once, it renders as expected. It's also not specific to transformed paths - I checked and it doesn't affect paths created using `addPath` method either.

event_with_uri_as_uid.ics

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (x11; linux x86_64; rv:78.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/78.0

steps to reproduce:

1. subscribe to a caldav calendar with thunderbird (i use baikal 0.8.0).
2. open the following ics file (produced by timeanddate.com) with thunderbird and attempt to add the event to your caldav calendar:
https://pintoch.ulminfo.fr/f43036d480/event_with_uri_as_uid.ics (also attached in this bug report)


actual results:

the event is not added to the calendar, with no error message.
(if the ics file was received as an email attachment and i tried to add it by clicking the ""add"" button next in the ""this message contains an event"" banner, then i get the error message ""processing message failed. status: 80004005."" which is really not informative at all)



expected results:

first, better error reporting is need. i would expect something like ""this event could not be added to the calendar ""my calendar"". the server responded with 404 error, calendar object not found.""

then, i would of course expect the event to actually be added to the calendar. the reason why this fails is that the ics file contains a url in the ""uid"" field, and thunderbird constructs the caldav url for the event by including this uid in the url without sufficient escaping or sanitization:
https://my.baikal.instance.com/cal.php/calendars/my_calendar/default/http%3a//www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html%3fiso%3d20210720t1400%26msg%3dreconciliation%20cg%20july%20meeting.ics

i believe the ""/"" character should be escaped as well.

if i open the ics file with a text editor and replace the uid by something alphanumeric, thunderbird successfully imports the event.","I'd rate this bug report as:

What I'd expect is a more helpful error message, like ""Can't add this event to your calendar because..."". And of course, I'd want the event to actually show up in my calendar! The problem seems to be that the .ics file has a URL in the ""uid"" field, and Thunderbird tries to use that as part of the CalDAV URL for the event. But since it doesn't properly escape or sanitize the URL, it fails. I think we should make sure to handle slashes (/) correctly too.

I've got a weird issue with Firefox on Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS. It seems like when I use the ""loop"" option on an audio file and then skip to the end, instead of restarting the audio where I left off, it just gets stuck at either 2:55 or 0:00. This is happening in versions 86.0 to 88.0a1, as well as the Extended Support Release (ESR) version 78.8.0.

To reproduce this issue, you can follow these steps: launch Firefox, go to a specific link that I'll leave out for now (it's just an audio test file), right-click on the seekbar and select ""loop"" from the context menu, then click on the seekbar again to skip to the end of the file. You'd expect the audio to restart where it left off since loop mode is active, but instead it gets stuck.

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:91.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/91.0

steps to reproduce:

- constrain the size of the root `<html>` element of a webpage so it is smaller than the viewport, e.g. with `width: 100px; height: 100px;`
- add a transition for the `<html>` element's `background` property, e.g. `transition: background 5s` to the style of a webpage's root `<html>` element
- change the background of the `<html>` element, e.g. through javascript

i've produced a codepen demo that demonstrates the issue: https://codepen.io/eritbh/pen/qwvpzjj


actual results:

the transition does not appear to redraw the canvas area outside the bounding box of the `<html>` element. moving the cursor in this area can cause the area to be redrawn periodically during the transition period. the behavior is slightly different depending on the opacities involved in the transition. i test two scenarios in the attached screen capture: the first transitions between `blue` and `black`, and the second between `transparent` (the default) and `black`. note that when a transparent color is involved, even when constantly moving the mouse around to trigger redraws, the color outside the root element appears to update at a different pace than the color inside.


expected results:

the background of the canvas area should transition smoothly, in time with the background of the root `<html>` element itself, without requiring cursor movement to trigger paints. this works as intended in current chromium-based browsers (tested against chrome canary 95.0.4608.0, edge stable 92.0.902.73).","I would rate this bug report as ""good"".

So I found a weird issue with Firefox - when you constrain the size of the root `<html>` element to be smaller than the viewport, and then add a transition for its background property, it doesn't seem to redraw the canvas area outside that bounding box. Even weirder is that if you move your mouse around in that area, it'll periodically get updated during the transition period - but only sometimes! It's like it's trying to keep up with itself, but not quite. I've got a CodePen demo set up here (https://codepen.io/eritbh/pen/qwvpzjj) that shows what I mean. What happens is that when you're transitioning between two colors - say blue and black, or transparent and black - the color outside the root element just won't update at the same pace as the inside. It's like it's stuck in a different time zone! This doesn't happen on Chromium-based browsers like Chrome Canary (tested against 95.0.4608.0) or Edge Stable (92.0.902.73)."

steps to reproduce:

we are privacy researchers evaluating the privacy implications of browser caching mechanisms. we have identified a bug in firefox 92.0.1 that presents a privacy threat to users as it can be used to re-identify them across private browsing sessions. specifically, we have found that cached options requests for cors resources persist after closing a private browsing window and opening a new one. in practice, attackers can encode a unique  identifier into a series of cors requests, and use it to track a user across private browsing sessions.

steps to reproduce:

open a website (in private browsing) which fetches a cross-origin resource, such that the 'access-control-max-age' header in response is set to a non-zero value. 

close and re-open the window and access the same url, and check if the options request is still cached

in the attached screenshot, we can see that a preflight request was not triggered for request 31, even after closing and re-opening the private window.

just like the example above, an user identifier can be encoded as a series of bits such that: 

cors cache hit=1
cors cache miss=0

this identifier would be able to persist across private browsing sessions, which presents a potential privacy vulnerability


actual results:

on closing the private browsing window and re-opening it, the cors preflight cache persists and the cross-origin resource is directly fetched without a preflight request. in essence, the cache is only cleared when the browser is terminated.



expected results:

on closing the private browsing window, the cors preflight cache should have been erased. in other words, when the window is reopened and the website is visited, there should be a preflight request triggered for resource 31 in the above screenshot.","I would rate this bug report as ""good"".

It seems that when you use private browsing mode and fetch some cross-origin resources, the browser can cache those requests in a way that's kinda sneaky. What's even worse is that once you close and reopen the private window, those cached requests just keep on persisting! For example, if someone encoded a unique identifier into those CORS requests, they could use it to track your activity across different private browsing sessions. To reproduce this bug, all you need to do is open a website in private mode that fetches some cross-origin resources (make sure the 'Access-Control-Max-Age' header is set), close and reopen the window, and then check if those cached requests are still there.

Then, I opened the Nightly browser with that profile, navigated to the privacy preferences page, scrolled down to the ""dismissed suggestions"" section, clicked ""learn more"", and watched the Sumo page... but there were no notes about the new restore dismissed suggestions functionality - it was like they just didn't exist!"

steps to reproduce:

we are developers on a 3d mapping web software, the software uses webgl and is compiled in wasm.

we encountered a peculiar behavior: 

1) it happens on firefox 105.0.1 on windows machine 
2) you need to have ""webgl.all-angle-options"" in the about:config set to true
3) navigate to https://dev.luciad.com/portal/packed-samples/ria/ogc3d/index.html?webgl&reference=epsg:4978

it opens a web page and then tries to load the city of marseille in fancy webgl

i am pretty sure this behavior is recent and the reproducibility is fairly high (although once in a while it works)

if i add some debug outputs, i can see that the issue arises when the application tries to invoke gllinkprogram. 




actual results:

firefox freezes for a second, the application becomes dark gray and then reappear. a ""device context"" loss is shown in the console along with other errors (that are due to the context loss)



expected results:


if you set webgl.all-angle-options to false, you can see that marseille loads without device context loss

no idea why it loses the device but something goes wrong in angle i guess","A bug report!

This issue started in Firefox 88, and I'll get back to you with a more specific regression range once I can test further - just FYI, this isn't reproducible if you're using the High Contrast White default theme."

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:91.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/91.0

steps to reproduce:

1. download pdf from https://chroniclesystems.co.uk/content/general/hosting-page/datasheet.pdf (file is also attached to this report).
2. view in firefox (windows 10 home) - observe that large splash image covers entire page (obscruing some content).
3. view in google chrome or adobe acrobat pro - observe that image is only crapped behind ""c"" logo, presumably as intended.

i presume a similar issue could also occour on other pdf documents, but i don't have any other examples.


actual results:

image covers entire page, obscruing some content.

screenshot of pdf viewer sidebar showing hatched thumbnails

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:78.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/78.0

steps to reproduce:

1. in about:preferences, under applications, set action for pdf documents to ""open in firefox"".
2. enable privacy.resistfingerprinting.
3. navigate to a url that returns a pdf document that can be displayed by firefox. for example, navigate to https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/duxbury/courses/phy480/cpp_refcard.pdf.
4. firefox may display a 'allow pdf.js t use your html5 canvas image data?' dialog near the address bar. if displayed, ignore the prompt or click on [x] 'close this message' in top-right corner of the dialog.
5. if sidebar is not visible, click on toggle sidebar button to display the sidebar.


actual results:

sidebar displays thumbnails of pdf document pages. each thumbnail is a white rectangle hatched with a different colour. thumbnails are not actual representations of the pdf pages.

work-around:
1. allow html5 canvas for the specified url.
2. refresh page.

each thumbnail in the sidebar should be a faithful representation of the actual pdf document page, regardless of privacy.resistfingerprinting setting.

Hey, I'm having an issue with Firefox's PDF viewer. When I set my browser to open PDFs in Firefox (in the settings under Applications) and enable that privacy feature called ""Resist Fingerprinting"", something weird happens. If I navigate to a URL that displays a PDF document (like this refcard from Michigan State University), the PDF opens in Firefox, but with a really strange sidebar showing up on the right-hand side. This sidebar is supposed to display thumbnails of each page in the PDF, but instead it's just filled with white rectangles that have different colored hatch marks - they're not even trying to represent what the actual pages look like! To make things worse, when I try to view the PDF, Firefox asks me if I want to allow it to use my browser's HTML5 canvas data. It's really annoying.

To reproduce this issue, you can follow these steps: set your action for PDFs to ""open in Firefox"" under Applications in the settings; enable Resist Fingerprinting; navigate to a URL that displays a PDF document (like that refcard I mentioned); if prompted, ignore or dismiss the canvas permission request; and finally, toggle the sidebar on.

firefox cursor state (regressed by bug 1758357).mp4

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:100.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/100.0
build id: 20220324215420

please refer to the attached screencast.

### steps to reproduce
1. open nightly into a non-maximised window.
2. move cursor from outside nightly window into some browser chrome areas or some `about:*` pages.
3. check the cursor state.

### actual result
cursor changes to `resize` when reaching the edge of nightly window, gets stuck at this state after leaving the edge (instead of reverting to `default`) until it should change state again.

### expected result
cursor changes to its appropriate state soon after leaving window edges.

### affected areas
1. most chrome areas except min/max/close buttons and some blank spaces.
2. some about:* pages e.g. about:addons, about:preferences, about:support **but not about:home**. i did not test all about:*
3. maximised window is **not** affected if the cursor is moved from another monitor.

So I found this weird issue where if you do a search and then navigate to one of those subpages (like images or videos) that show up beneath the search bar, the search term sticks around even though it shouldn't.

To reproduce this, just launch Firefox, do a search, press enter, then quickly click on one of those subpages before the search tip goes away - it's a bit tricky to time it right, but it can happen. What should happen is that the full URL shows up in the address bar, but instead, the search term persists. This issue happens with Google and Bing, but not with DuckDuckGo (which just sticks the search term on there anyway).

It should be nice and centered, but for some reason it's all messed up now.

Hey there, I'm reporting an issue with Firefox on my Windows 10 machine (but it also happens on Mac and Linux). When I have session restore enabled and I open the ""about:preferences"" page with something other than the search pane displayed (like the sync pane), things get weird. Here's what I did:

I opened a new browser window with that profile, then went into preferences and set some specific settings for URL bar quicksuggestions (it's a long story). After restarting Firefox, I clicked on the ""Customize in Settings"" button from the onboarding modal, expecting to be taken back to the ""about:preferences"" page with the search pane focused. But instead, I ended up stuck on the sync pane! That's not what I wanted.

What happened was that the browser redirected me to the same ""about:preferences"" page, but it kept the sync pane in focus, even though I had previously changed the settings. It's like Firefox got stuck in a loop or something. To make matters worse, when I clicked on the button, the browser console started spitting out errors - there were these weird messages about lazy browsers and null properties. It was like Firefox was having some kind of existential crisis!

Anyway, I've attached a screen recording of what happened so you can see it for yourself. I'm hoping someone can help me figure out what's going on here and how to fix it."

Hey, so I encountered this weird issue in Firefox. It happened to me when using versions 92.0b7 and 93.0a1 on my Windows 10 machine with a 64-bit setup.

After that, I flipped the switch on high contrast mode and opened the download panel - big mistake! When I hovered my mouse over the ""Cancel download"" or ""Open containing folder"" options, the whole panel just went dark. It's like the elements vanished into thin air.

What I was expecting to see, though, is that the download panel would adapt nicely to high contrast and the system theme, displaying everything properly. Instead, it looks like a blank slate with no hover effects. Anyway, I'll try to find out when this issue started creeping in (I know, ""regression range"" sounds fancy, but essentially it's just me trying to figure out when things went awry).

""So, I've been experiencing this weird issue with Zoom audio on Firefox. To reproduce it, you need to make sure you're running at least version 88.0 of Firefox (stable, not beta). Then, just launch the browser and join any Zoom meeting - it doesn't matter if there's only two people or a whole bunch more. Just listen to what the speaker is saying, and you'll notice that the audio starts tearing apart in weird ways. It gets pretty hard to make out what they're saying unless they slow down their speech big time. This issue shows up on not one, but two completely different PCs I have, so I don't think it's a hardware-specific problem.

open an avif image in its own tab (e.g. file:///c:/users/user/desktop/profilebanner.avif).
refresh (f5) until tab crashes (usually takes ~5-15 attempts). it doesn't matter how fast or slow you refresh (tested with ~200ms delay and ~4 second delay).

i've had the best luck in getting the tab to crash with the attached image. i tried to crash the tab with smaller image sizes but was unable to replicate this bug. this image doesn't crash on chrome.

alternatively, include an avif image as a css `background-image: url()` and refresh the page or the url itself (e.g. swapping between webp and avif image urls).

""I was testing out Sidebery on Firefox and noticed that after updating it, some of my keyboard shortcuts stopped working in one of the windows. I'm talking about things like F1 (or Ctrl+E) to open/close the sidebar, Alt+Up/Down to select tabs, and Alt+Space to activate selection - all those usual suspects weren't doing what they were supposed to do anymore. When I checked the browser console, I saw some errors pop up on update. One of them said something about a context not being found, and then when I tried using my keyboard shortcuts again, it told me there was a TypeError saying it couldn't access the 'canaccesswindow' property because `this.extension` was null. It was like the whole thing just broke after updating! What's supposed to happen is that all the windows should still be working with those shortcuts, but now one of them is totally wonky. I've checked out some other issues people have had with Sidebery and it looks like this might be related to some bigger problems they're trying to figure out."""

screenshot showing missing/invisible icons

user agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:99.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/99.0

steps to reproduce:

- open thunderbird (i'm doing this on windows 10)
    - it doesn't seem to matter if dark mode is enabled/disabled
    - i have no add-ons installed
- double click an email to pop it out into it's own window

- in the customize window, make sure icons are set to be visible
- drag any of the following to the toolbar
    - tasks
    - calendar
    - add as task
    - add as event


actual results:

the icon will not be visible (the text will be).
other custom items seem to display correctly although there may be others than the ones i mentioned above that cause issues.

the icons should display along with the text (when icons are set to be visible from the 'customize toolbar' window.","Based on the provided text, I would rate it:

Here's what's going down: when I pop an email out into its own window by double-clicking it, then right-click on the Mail toolbar and go to Customize, I can see all the icons just fine. But then I drag one of those special items like Tasks, Calendar, Add as Task, or Add as Event over to the toolbar... and poof! The icon is gone, but the text remains. It's super weird because other custom items seem to work okay (at least that I've tried), so it might be specific to these particular ones.

steps to reproduce:

disclaimer: used safe mode, created a new profile, this issue is reproducible on latest firefox on macos with absolute defaults.

the svg ""animate"" child element allows animating an attribute xxx. after animation and after deleting the responsible ""animate"" element, the attribute xxx seems locked to the animated value.

behavior reproducible : using https://codepen.io/hariseldon778/pen/vyxmojz click on x=15 and x=35 : circle.cx is assigned properly. after clicking on anim or delanim the circle.cx coordinate can't be assigned anymore by clicking on x=15 or x=35

deduced : once an svg ""circle"" has an ""animate"" child element targeting attributename ""cx"", then ""cx"" can't be assigned after animation.


actual results:

actual result : the circle didn't move - circle.cx is not assignable anymore after removing its svg/smil animation


expected results:

expected result : the circle should have moved - circle.cx is thus expected assignable after removing its svg/smil animation.

""I'm experiencing an issue with Firefox on my Mac (running 10.15). I created a new profile and used safe mode to isolate the problem. It seems that when you use the 'animate' element in SVG to animate an attribute like `cx`, it locks in the animated value even after you delete the animation. To reproduce this, I went to this CodePen example [https://codepen.io/hariseldon778/pen/vyxmojz], clicked on ""x=15"" and then ""x=35"", which successfully assigned a new `cx` coordinate to the circle. But when I clicked on either ""anim"" or ""delanim"", the `cx` coordinate became stuck at its final value - it wouldn't update again even if I tried clicking on those values. It seems like once an SVG circle has an 'animate' child element targeting an attribute like `cx`, that attribute can't be reassigned after the animation is removed. The actual result is that the circle doesn't move and the `cx` coordinate becomes non-assignable, whereas my expected result was that the circle would have moved and I'd be able to reassign the `cx` coordinate."""

1861,"with thunderbird daily on linux or windows, an event created by converting a plain text email with more than one line in the body can not be saved on some caldav servers (e.g. radicale) due to cr characters in the description property of the ical object.

steps to reproduce:
1. configure a mail account.  (any type.)
2. subscribe to a network calendar.  (type can be icalendar or caldav.  offline support on or off.)
3. create a draft email message in plain text format (e.g. by holding shift when clicking the write button), with a subject, where the body contains at least 2 lines.  for example:
   subject: solstice party
   body:
   solstice party at my house, 2021-12-21 8:00pm.
   refreshments will be provided.
4. save and close the draft.
5. right-click on the draft in the drafts folder, then click convert to->event...
6. click the ""save and close"" button to save and close the event.

at this point, thunderbird will send a request to create an icalendar event with a description property that contains cr characters in its value (before \n escape sequences).  this causes some caldav servers (e.g. radicale) to reject the update because cr is not permitted in text values, except as part of line folding.  (see [section 3.3.11 of rfc 5545](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.11).)  thunderbird displays

When I create an event from a plain text email with more than one line in the body, it won't save to certain CalDAV servers (like Radicale).

The report clearly describes the issue, provides relevant context, and includes a demo link to reproduce the problem.
* Grammar: Best
The writing is clear, concise, and free of grammatical errors.

As for the 4 items you mentioned:

1. Steps to Reproduce (S2R): Present and detailed
2. Expected Result (ER): Clearly stated
3. Actual Result (AR): Described
4. Additional Information: Included (software version, build number, environment)

Overall, I'd rate this bug report as ""Best"".",14,16,87.5,True,1,True,1,False,0,True,1,False,0,False,0,True,2,True,1,True,1,True,2,True,2,True,2,True,1,"Here's the rewritten bug report in a conversational tone:

I'm reporting an issue I encountered when using Firefox (Mozilla/5.0) on my Mac. The problem happens when I go to this specific URL: https://bl.ocks.org/nolanlawson/ef0cebcb48a5cf958d176056486642cd. When I load the page, I'm expecting it to say ""focused: second"" and for the second input field to have focus. But instead, it says ""focused: first"" and the first input is highlighted - not what I was hoping for! As you can see from the attached screenshot, Chrome 95 and Safari 15.1 get it right, though.

It seems like this issue might be related to whether the focusable elements are inside an iframe or not. If they're not inside an iframe (like in this demo: https://bl.ocks.org/nolanlawson/ef0cebcb48a5cf958d176056486642cd), all three browsers behave correctly, showing ""focused: second"" and focusing the right input.

The weird part is that it's specifically this line of code causing the problem:
```
div.shadowroot.queryselector('.second').focus()
div.focus()
```
Since `div` is a shadow host with `delegatesfocus` set to true, I'd expect focusing it not to affect the focus from the second input to the first."

Hey, I wanted to file this weird issue that happened when I was browsing the Defense News website (https://www.defensenews.com). So, here's what went down: I was using Firefox Nightly 88.0a1 on my Windows 10 Pro x64 machine, and I had all my extensions set to ""strict"" mode with a clean profile. When I navigated to the Defense News site, I expected it to load normally, but instead, I got a pop-up message complaining about an ad-blocker (even though I'm not actually blocking ads). To top it off, when I tried reloading the page, the issue persisted.

So, I've been testing Firefox nightly (version 93.0a1) and noticed an issue that happens on both my Mac (with macOS 11.5.2) and Ubuntu Linux (20.04 x64). To reproduce it, you need to have a specific profile set up: go to about:config, find the ""messaging-system.rsexperimentloader.collection_id"" pref and set it to ""nimbus-preview"". Then, install this add-on called ""remote settings devtools"" from here. Now, make sure your browser is set as default and you're not connected to a captive portal (but one is available). Here's what I did: I opened the browser with that profile, clicked the ""remote settings devtools"" button, changed the ""environment"" to ""stage"", restarted the browser, logged in to the captive portal using the auto-opened login window, and then observed the browser. What I expected to happen was that I'd see this ""vpn promo"" infobar pop up - but it didn't show up at all! The login was successful, but no infobar.

""Hey, I'm having an issue with the library menu in Firefox. It started happening after the latest nightly build (88.0a1). To recreate it, I need about 30 sites loaded in my history and then I drag and drop the library icon from the customize page into the toolbar. Then, if I click on the library icon, go to the history option, and quickly close the sub-panel using the ""<"" button, the library panel gets broken. If I repeat those steps a few times, it'll happen right away. What's supposed to happen is that the library panel should just work as usual, but instead, it gets messed up. This is a regression, which means it started happening after some recent changes were made to Firefox (specifically around this change: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/pushloghtml?fromchange=97565326ca40d150f65bae3acf92178851180ca1&tochange=0c5f0b28261bfe990f6e3bc71fd57d1a32e69082).
